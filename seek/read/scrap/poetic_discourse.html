Book 2 - Poetic Discourse for the jaded mind<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
////////////////clarity<br>
<br>
light is lit. <br>
candles burning. <br>
lantern yearning. <br>
light house glowing. <br>
beacons flowing.<br>
<br>
+++<br>
<br>
Grains of sand in infinitude<br>
what similitude shall embrace?<br>
cosmic grains juxtaposed with that<br>
life giving lamp on the beach of eternity<br>
The light of oneness pervades the sea, or<br>
rather grains adrift in ethereal light<br>
Light upon Light - what dim reflection,<br>
what small conception can we attain?<br>
Of that grand architect - adrift in<br>
the grand design, a course inscribed through time<br>
Each grain a shore with infinitely more<br>
atoms of reflected light<br>
and what a delight it certainly is<br>
to reflect on eternal light<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy<br>
oh how comely<br>
come to me my love<br>
rush; do not haste<br>
there is absolutely absolute time we <br>
must waste<br>
absolute perfection we must face<br>
on the doorstep of the absolute<br>
do we pace<br>
<br>
ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy<br>
quick, so quick<br>
rush in autumn rustling<br>
my love - absolute<br>
in the air; the flute<br>
<br>
+++++<br>
<br>
Momentary frame of clarity<br>
Hung up on my wall<br>
An instant infinite<br>
Every leaf - breath of fall<br>
Arranged in jigsaw order<br>
Fragments coalesce<br>
And “I” becomes a tapestry’s strand; the thread of my lover’s dress<br>
Bliss and whole, I cannot hold on too long<br>
Before I’m dragged back into mundane fog<br>
<br>
My lover leaves<br>
Disorder proceeds<br>
And “so long…” I say<br>
“…for now”<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
come create your self<br>
each day anew<br>
cremate the prior one<br>
<br>
we’ll go to vacant parking lots<br>
far beyond the sovereignty of ink pens<br>
and laugh our way into fault<br>
<br>
where poetry only aspires<br>
there will we lie<br>
<br>
my hands will trace yours will trace<br>
butterfly flutters<br>
<br>
we’ll etch-a-sketch each other<br>
<br>
and erode into the sea<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
No words<br>
Through worries<br>
No woes<br>
<br>
Two words<br>
Rage fury<br>
Two worlds; are foes<br>
<br>
Five sounds<br>
a e i o u<br>
And an ever present “why?”<br>
<br>
Stare up<br>
Stare down<br>
Dscend the spheres. Cry.<br>
<br>
Pick apart<br>
Then piece together<br>
Before the thought would have been better<br>
<br>
But here we are<br>
There I am<br>
Words abound - mishaped fetters<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
Everything is crumbling before my eyes<br>
The desert sands have devised<br>
To rise and fall - do not be surprised<br>
<br>
My tongue is sandpaper<br>
My lips are cracked<br>
<br>
Through this desert reside my tracks<br>
<br>
May I return to abode <br>
And drink from kawthar<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
You are the quenching of my thirst<br>
And the easing of my pain<br>
A mercy from the Merciful<br>
My dearly beloved<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
Oh black nighted empress<br>
Dancing around undressed in the corner of my eye<br>
How your exhales impress<br>
Subtle patterns of interwoven years<br>
Through these gnarled and weary bones<br>
Here we rest between thrones<br>
On the saber’s edge of eternity<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
Expanse of silences<br>
Lined with lovely lace<br>
<br>
Words<br>
Come to be then vanish<br>
No remaining trace<br>
<br>
+++++<br>
<br>
Millennia was her name<br>
A thousand years from head to toe<br>
Empires rose and fell between her lips<br>
The seasons changed around her hips<br>
Navies sank underneath her finger tips<br>
<br>
Every hundered years she’d leave a note;<br>
“I know they sent for me, however, I’m busy until next century”<br>
<br>
Armies fought to the death<br>
Over who had rightful claim to her breath<br>
And who she did like best<br>
<br>
Twas all foolish though, don’t you know?<br>
A thousand years from head to toe<br>
And a thousand more between blinks<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
You are electric love<br>
Woven strands<br>
Paint brush bristle lashes<br>
Currently sailing absolute<br>
Sinews sinusoidal<br>
Electric love hallucinations<br>
Dancing beside my ears<br>
I am<br>
Collapsed point, eternity’s sigh, pen ink<br>
Glass castle ripples<br>
Water vapor amblings<br>
And whatever else one may think<br>
<br>
You are electric love<br>
And I am drowning<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
What to do with ecstasy,<br>
When my body lay next to me?<br>
Write and spill I think may work<br>
<br>
If only for a bit<br>
<br>
A method of sheer habit<br>
<br>
Love is love even with no lover found<br>
Love directed objectlessly<br>
<br>
Everyday tis a bit unnerving<br>
All the conditioned layers unearthing<br>
<br>
Until I’m but heart and breath<br>
Write and spill; my work upon the earth<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
Threads never sever, through days of grievous weather, whether you really like it <br>or not.<br>
<br>
The sound of forever rings defiantly.<br>
<br>
Every instant a reminder; you will return.<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
Some location off the coast of forever, <br>
far past forever, <br>
where forever and forever meet. <br>
Forever and I met in secret. <br>
We exchanged secrets. Then parted ways. <br>
<br>
Forever later she and I returned and laughed and parted yet again. <br>
This time by the fountain. <br>
And we stared into each other’s eyes and saw forever. <br>
And we did not stop until forever ended. <br>
And then she died. <br>
And I died too. <br>
And forever began again.<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
The constant rushing torrent of a trillion flowering words<br>
<br>
The birds they sing<br>
My ears do ring<br>
My heart does the engendering<br>
<br>
The constant motion feeling of an endless stampede<br>
<br>
The hooves do stride<br>
The cleaving and the sundering<br>
<br>
I promise I have completely lost my mind<br>
<br>
Search and find<br>
The paper does hide<br>
What you whisper in my ear<br>
<br>
The constant rushing torrent<br>
Of a trillion flowering words<br>
<br>
I do not sleep<br>
I wish I cared<br>
But the night dances undressed<br>
<br>
We merge<br>
And sing our song<br>
Until the thread of dawn separates us again<br>
<br>
The constant rushing torrent….<br>
I cannot write in words<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
Behind solid sheets of steel like glass the hours seem to<br>
drift and pass.<br>
From then to now, an eternity,<br>
That haphazardly returns to me<br>
in a single burst of memorial light.<br>
Colored by vibrations,<br>
Imbued with ineffable sensations,<br>
These jewels of timeless splendor<br>
Only with time become ever more difficult to remember.<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
I fear looking into your eyes for I might never see another thing again<br>
The corner of your smile enfolding me<br>
The strands of your hair unfurling me<br>
The rhythm of your heart entrancing me<br>
The peak of your shout impaling me<br>
The contour of your speech lulling me<br>
The grace of your movement unbalancing me<br>
The edge of your wit dissecting me<br>
The torrent of you anger enslaving me<br>
The resolve of your will supporting me<br>
The weight of your sighs collapsing me<br>
The sight of your tears drowning me<br>
I fear looking into your eyes<br>
<br>
For all these things they do comprise<br>
<br>
And I’d never see an existent thing again<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////confusion<br>
<br>
Welcome to the end of the pavement<br>
Lets pave our way out of the basement<br>
Through the cracks in the floorboard<br>
Freebased crack - based on true stories<br>
Will bloom<br>
Head splits aching will loom<br>
Woven into never quite complete quilts<br>
Enmeshed in my subconscious<br>
Ensnared by lack of conscience<br>
A wicked man… these are my notes from underground <br>
Heard through cracks in my plastered exterior<br>
<br>
All EXIT signs point home<br>
And I exist as a string of lone points<br>
Drifting down the nile of historically ordinary dreams<br>
Banked by left and right stereo channels<br>
3.5mm bound triptych panels <br>
Artificially scented Chanel #5<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
all these years of facial recognition programming<br>
have rendered me unable to recognize<br>
your simple gestures<br>
they only register as<br>
bits of 1’s and 0’s<br>
reappearing recursively <br>
it’s a bitter curse, you see<br>
years of facial recognition programming in<br>
my basement<br>
i’m now a qbase head -basically<br>
nearly brain dead, but not quite fully<br>
<br>
just enough left to construct an intricate<br>
pulley system<br>
between my two ears that operates by<br>
my few tears<br>
shed…<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
A rose<br>
A petal<br>
I picked and plucked<br>
In wait to give to you<br>
My singular love - a petal incarnates.<br>
Contrive I may, I cannot say<br>
A single word anew<br>
It is therefore my sincere hope<br>
That this single petal will do…<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
Cultural myth making<br>
Pseudo intellectual breath taking<br>
Panoramic devastation<br>
Of our distant echoes reverberating<br>
Through and through<br>
This collective mess we’re making<br>
<br>
Schizophrenic passages<br>
Ascending through and ravishing<br>
Drowning in my bathtub<br>
The end the end the end the end<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
A tale of thirty thousand lovers torn<br>
One love - an ever present thorn<br>
Smiles teeth enfolded ears<br>
Muddy ink throughout the years<br>
<br>
A reflection above the sink<br>
Gun point held - quick! Think!<br>
False alarm<br>
Was the running faucet<br>
False alarm<br>
Was the hidden closet<br>
False alarm was the reaching arms<br>
False alarm<br>
Was my fallen yearnings<br>
False alarm <br>
Was her packed up boxes<br>
False alarm<br>
Was the silent lobby<br>
False alarm<br>
Was your new found hobby<br>
False alarm<br>
Was a false alarm<br>
<br>
Woke up dreaming<br>
<br>
But was a false alarm<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
A momentary water vapor mist<br>
Must by nature cease to exist<br>
Exit out the last remaining door<br>
Before or after an excessive need to implore<br>
<br>
An effervescent temporary sighting<br>
Of a grandeur altogether frightening<br>
Awe striking<br>
Bike riding<br>
Men striving<br>
Nerve deciding<br>
Astral sighting<br>
Back biting<br>
Temporary mist<br>
<br>
Rising in illustrious forms<br>
In love and alone<br>
Typing on a phone<br>
Ready to jump out the window<br>
<br>
Ready to drive off a bridge<br>
<br>
Ready to sink to the bottom of the sea<br>
<br>
Ready for there to no longer be me<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
You have ruined my sanity<br>
And I will not forgive you<br>
<br>
Until you take back these memories<br>
And return the keys to my heart<br>
<br>
Attached to them a letter that reads<br>
“Ease for broken parts”<br>
<br>
+++++<br>
<br>
My brain is fried<br>
I’ve tried to comprehend it all<br>
But all I managed was to scrawl<br>
A simple note<br>
That read; “hello, I love you. Goodbye.”<br>
<br>
Every little sliver<br>
Contains an infinitely long river<br>
That never remains the same<br>
<br>
And every face hides another just the same - only given a different name<br>
<br>
And within these pockets - a few hundred years<br>
<br>
Tell me friend - was I a fool?<br>
They certainly did not talk about this in school.<br>
<br>
I’ve examined every science<br>
But they all are the same<br>
Shifting water given various names<br>
<br>
I’ve tried and tried<br>
With no luck<br>
Billy pilgrim has become unstuck<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
<br>
Seasons change and faces shift, <br>
sworn eternal lovers now in hatred. <br>
Banished hence an exile in the kingdom, <br>
wrought tales did the devilish seamstress spin. <br>
In effervescent landscapes did our player travel, <br>
pendulums, time warps, grains of glass did pass.<br>
<br>
How weary now, our exile did beg; “Please. No more, let me lay my head.”<br>
<br>
And so, kindly did the seamstress comply. <br>
Every strand did she sever, <br>
except the one named “forever.”<br>
<br>
+++++++<br>
