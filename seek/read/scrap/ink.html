here we go again<br>
the keeper<br>
and the cryptic pen<br>
the key that locks the meaning<br>
>>>>secrets of;<br>
>>>>>>>>federations scheming<br>
>>>>>>>>eyes that glisten deceiving<br>
>>>>>>>>waves that carry feeling<br>
<br>
it dawns on us that the dawn approaches<br>
and it is in this twilight hour that the thoughts<br>
of majesty and granduer most filter in<br>
from where?<br>
from the source of all existence<br>
the waters of knowledge and life<br>
the ink of existence<br>
penned by the grand author<br>
flow into this world and manifest themselves<br>
in myriad forms<br>
endless forms of splendor<br>
<br>
and buried in the darkness of sleep<br>
that is soon to arrrive<br>
is the silent reminder<br>
of a home we shall return to<br>
veiled from the eye<br>
that sees the daylight<br>
<br>
and it may seem that i have nothing new to write<br>
nothing but the same themes cycling over and over<br>
this is true<br>
but as i've always believed<br>
-best to explore a single lover infinitely<br>
than to singley explore infinite lovers<br>
and it is this woven tapestry<br>
of scale and awe<br>
of fear and terror<br>
of beautific visions<br>
and pouring ink<br>
that i have fallen so dearly in love<br>
<br>
this single being<br>
whose names are many<br>
and yet is only one<br>
<br>
i have forgotten much<br>
and neglected more<br>
but this negligence itself serves as a greater reminder<br>
of this journey i never chose<br>
yet remain the steady traveller<br>
