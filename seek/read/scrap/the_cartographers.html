the cartographers<br>
<br>
a trio of beings whose sole purpose is to map the every aspect of the existence<br>
to encode it in ever more compact forms<br>
all the way down to the smallest point<br>
the kernel that all reality manifests from<br>
the "kun"<br>
to truely access their realm one must have particular huruf (arabic letters)<br>
ا ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه ؤ ى<br>
their process is fairly straight forward<br>
every arrangement of huruf corresponds to some aspect of reality<br>
they continually arrange the huruf in varying combinations and record<br>
through this process every contingency, existent thing, event, and process<br>
is encoded<br>
<br>
to the collector of the huruf aspects of this ideal realm of representation<br>
are accessed in slivers<br>
the cartographers exist somewhere orthogonal to every possible dimension<br>
that is to say their true location is cureled up into an infinitesimal<br>
their realm exists in all locations, but to access it is quite difficult<br>
and once there it is even harder to specify the return<br>
