The Light<br><br>

i swear by allah these are all true stories, things that occured to me over the course of my life
either during waking life, in a half-aware state, or in complete dream. i write them to the best of my memory.
they were all so "vivid" that i call them "openings" or "flashes of light" - they linger in my memory to this day and i hold them as personal "evidence"<br>
<br>
i dedicate them to writing so i can share them with others and to keep them fresh in my memory as i get older and the darkness seems to grow.<br>
<br>
1. |||||angel in switzerland - a blessed nap beside a giant and wise tree<br>
	::this was the first of the "major" openings. it was in my final year of juvenile incarceration.
	after the first 2 years of internal struggle and turmoil and incessant reading all my books and recreational activities were taken away
	somehow a small copy of the quran was found in the housing unit and so i began reading it and fasting the month of ramadan
	on one beautiful day during normal outdoor recreation hour i decided to pray outside by the large tree overtop the field.
	after praying i remained on the ground and laid down to drift off into a nap.
	for a brief moment - just after my waking awareness slipped, but still aware enough to sense the enviornment around me
	i saw this being of pure light gently approach me
	the intensity of the light made distinguishing a "form" rather difficult, but there was a very faint trace of a kind of body
	it was too subtle to really define but nevertheless it was there
	and this entity (what i later came to believe to be an angel) just remained beside me for a brief moment
	and then i returned to normal waking consciousness
	and i felt within my heart a kind of opening.... as if a spring opened up and this outflow of love coursed through me
	and for the rest of the day i remained silent
	everything that i ever associated with the feeling of love crossed my mind, but this was more intense than any of those
	and so i kept that with me and took it as a gift. <br>
<br>
	(a couple years later while on break at burlington coat factory in Alexandria VA, i met a young man sitting on the bench i
	normally eat my lunch at. we began talking. he shared a donut with me. at some point he said salaam and we figured we were both muslim.
	he proceeded to tell me a story of a similar angelic experience while working at at local restraunt during ramadan. the way he described the
	angel was so similar that i took this as a sort of secondary confirmation....)<br>
<br>
	allahualim.<br>
<br>
2. |||||the name of allah in the pavement - two musicians run for their lives (hyattsville)<br>
	::this moment came during a period of intense creativity and friendship with someone i had become friends with (Ibrahim Keita)
	he and some friends shared an amazing house on the outskrits of Washington D.C. and would all make music and art and things.
	through a very sudden encounter at NVCC we started our friendship - mainly from one song that resulted in the production of several others
	and performing in a fashion show at American University.
	Anyway, on this particular day he and i decided to go on a walk through the woods - the time was a bit before sunset and so their was still daylight out
	we walked through the neighborhood and followed the trail through the woods out towards what i believe was the playground for a school not too far away.
	we stayed there for a while jumping around and playing with the musical things they had set out. not before long two police cars showed up with their lights on
	and called us to them. they sat as down and asked for personal information. when we wasked what was going on they informed us that the park closes after dusk
	and that there had recently been a homocide in the area. they gave us a warning and told us to leave. so leave we did. except, they told us we couldn't use the same path
	that we had used to get to the park. we took the longer road, talked, laughed, etc. 
	Until we reached a portion of our night adventure where we had to return through the same trail through the woods. The sun had completely set and aside from the faint
	streetlights illuminating the entrance to the trail the rest was absolute darkness. i pulled out my cellphone to turn on the flashlight, but as i was fumbling with my phone
	we both heard a strange metallic sound deeper in the woods and a kind of groan.
	Before i knew it Ibrahim was gone! i laughed for a moment thinking someone was probably just playing around or perhaps it was a homeless person. But then I realized
	"well if ibrahim ran away i might as well join him"
	so i found him hiding behind a car, when i asked what was going on he reminded me "don't your remember the police said there was a homocide"
	after we calmed down and laughed it off he and i began walking back to the house yet again taking a longer detour through the neighborhood.
	and... wallahi! As SOON as he and i stepped foot on the concrete sidewalk of the neighborhood we saw the name "ALLAH" inscribed in arabic.
	we both looked at each other and were amazed.....<br>
<br>
	allahualim.<br>
<br>
3. |||||the dream of idris - i am going to kill death! (les autres house)<br>
	::this one came during the same few months i was heavily active with Ibrahim and the rest of that house in Hyattsville MD
	it came in the form of a dream. I generally slept either in the attic of the house or the basement. This morning i awoke feeling refreshed
	and i clearly recalled the dream i had just prior to waking - i was in a forest kind of area with some leafless trees roaming around when all of a sudden
	a man comes from the depth of the forest to me and says distinctly <br>
																						"I am Idris and I am going to kill death"<br>
	that was it. nothing more. nothing less. and from that day anytime that name came up or i saw any information regarding the prophet Idris I would be extra attentive.
	it wasn't until much much later - probably 3 or so years that a more recent muslim friend gave me some insight into a possible meaning of the dream. he mentioned to me
	that Idris is associated with the biblical Enoch. He was apparently a very scholarly prophet attributed with the earliest use of the pen and also it's said that his deat
	occured in the 4th heaven. as in he ascended in body and spirit and when he finally "died" i.e. had his spirit taken from his body it occured in the 4th "heaven/firmament"<br>
<br>
	allahualim.<br>
<br>
4. |||||jafar al sadiq weaping tears of pearl (NJ)<br>
	::this dream occured one night while living in new jersey.
	I was a distant observer looking outwards towards an ornate and traditional looking wooden balcony.
	the balcony was overlooking a vast mountainous area. the atmosphere was serene and contemplative.
	on the balcony i saw 4 men all in tashahud (sitting legs at end of prayer)
	the one on the far left was dressed in all white robes and had a white turban
	to the right of him were 3 others dressed in brown robes
	the man in white was crying. my awareness in the dream shifted to a close up of his eyes and i saw the tears coming out
	they appeared almost as mercury - when they formed into droplets it was as if they were pearls
	the 3 men were in a sense receiving these pearls from the one in white
	as soon as they took from him they vanished and 3 more appeared.... he remained fixed
	upon waking i had the intuitive sensation that that man was Ja'far al-Sadiq (one of the descendents of the prophet)<br>
<br>
5. |||||the jewel - escape from the prison and into the caravan of color, right behind Rasul + Abu Bakr<br>
	::this dream occured in the same period of time as the Jafar al Sadiq dream.
	Still living in NJ, to the best of my memory I can say that it was an ordinary night.
	The dream started out with me in a prison cell in some cold and remote location.
	out of nowhere Sgt. Carp (the cool one from unit 13) comes and unlocks the door for me and just walks away.
	I make my way outside and the place is covered in snow. I notice that my right hand has this magic power, whenever
	I close it I lift up into the air and slowly drift down. I did this a few times and floated above the roof of the prison.
	I was nervous because I was unsure of this ability, whether it was reliable or not.
	After a few more trials I was convinced this power wouldn't leave and so I shot off high into the sky. 
	There's a portion of the dream where I was on that ledge in that one Halo 2 multiplayer map with a sniper rifle.
	I think I was being hunted or something... I'm not quite sure... Anywa. After that portion cleared up I remember seeing the entire
	prison facility enclosed in a circular fence. Within the fence everything was cold and snow covered, but just outside the gate seemed
	to be this paradise like jungle. I drift over the perimeter fence and the whole prison world vanished out of sight. As I slowly drifted
	down towards the ground I saw this massive caravan of people and animals all dressed in multicolored fabrics. It was a gorgeous parade.
	I ended up landing just behind the two figures who were leading the parade, and as I stood up I had this sensation that I KNEW
	who these two figures were. One was the Rasul PBUH and the other was Abu Bakr RA.<br>
<br>
6. |||||the golden dagger - one of the naqshaband giving me a relic<br>
	::this one took place while in the rutgers behavioral health and came in the form of episodic dreams.
	the first episode was reminsicent in that i was roaming around my childhood neighborhood in NJ and talking to 
	sam on the phone. I told him that I believed I was ready to become the disciple of a spiritiual master.
	the sky was a beautiful purple and I was surrounded with amazing blue tulips. I was then awoken.
	the real "mystic" part came in the third episode that same morning.
	I found myself out in this large field in what almost seemed like a fair. There were all sorts of people going to and fro.
	amidst the crowd I saw several people wearing the traditional naqshbandi dress.
	I ran up to one and tugged on his outer cloak inorder to speak with him. He immediately turned to me
	and pulled out this ancient and ornate looking golden dagger and gave it to me<br>
<br>
7. |||||dhikr - walking - the fever - the opening of the huruf - the knife and the rope i.e. 6 months in Florida<br>
	::This one happened prior to #6, it was during the short 6 months I was living in florida with my mom.
	Then I had no car, I couldn't find a job, and I was on no medication, so I would spend most days walking to the masjid.
	I made a lot of dhikr at that time. On several occasions I had some rather intense experiences<br>
		1. the dogs running at me<br>
		2. the sudden all encompassing fever<br>
		3. tahajjud posession/seizure?<br>
		4. chanting the huruf<br>
		5. mom's light<br>
		6. perfect intuition - Hai!<br>
<br>
