zeno dialogue [memory of democritus]<br>
<br>
b; Master Zeno!<br>
z; yes my boy<br>
b; master Zeno… I am very tired…<br>
z; have you not rested?<br>
b; no, not in that sense.<br>
I have been studying the works of the masters,<br>
and been very observant, but…<br>
It seems like I cannot hold to anything.<br>
Even the glimmers of understanding seem to vanish after some time.<br>
<br>
z; ahh… Yes.<br>
Tell me. What is it you have been studying?<br>
<br>
b; it’s very hard for me to say anymore,<br>
all I remember is the question that spurred the inquiry.<br>
<br>
z; well go on then.<br>
<br>
b; well… What am I?<br>
This leaf here, what is it?<br>
The change in day and night?<br>
The shadows cast on the ground?<br>
The buildings and markets? Our dreams?<br>
The words and wishes and ideas? The numbers?<br>
What is any of it?<br>
I have asked the others, some have given me answers,<br>
others have scoffed. But without fail the answers given are not satisfying,<br>
they only push the question farther into the background.<br>
<br>
z; how so?<br>
<br>
b; yesterday in the market,<br>
Democritus came to my fathers shop and chanced to see me musing over a small bug in my hand.<br>
He came to me and asked me a question<br>
<br>
“Boy, suppose you were to tear that little creature in half, what would you find?”<br>
<br>
“Blood.” I replied.<br>
<br>
“Certainly. Now… If you were to take that blood and tear it once more, then?”<br>
<br>
“I cannot say.” I replied.<br>
<br>
“Very well… Let it be know,<br>
if one had the means to continue tearing, eventually he would reach an end.<br>
I call these indestructibles "atoms.” The world and all you know is composed of such.“<br>
<br>
z; Yes I am familiar with Democritus’ idea, and then?<br>
<br>
b; Well… For a moment I thought to destroy the bug in the hopes to confirm for myself whether this was true.<br>
But I chose not to. That night, my mind still mulling over this idea, I found no solace.<br> 
I thought of how these might configure.<br>
I thought of how one may be able to transform one form into another.<br>
Yet the truth or falsity of Democritus’ idea seemed to bring me no closer to the answer which I seek.<br>
<br>
z; certainly not.<br>
<br>
b; and I have read Einstein and Heidegger, debroglie, Bohr, Bohm, Socrates, plato, patanjali, Ibn Arabi, Sartre, Camus, Kant, Descartes, rumi, schrodinger, Euler, poincare, cantor, Godel, Hofstadter, khayyam, shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, Mandelbrot, Newton, Frege, Ptolemy, Feynman, kaku, Greene and many more… The names have all together evaporated.<br>
<br>
And still. I seem to know no more or less.<br>
<br>
z; certainly.<br>
<br>
b; Master Zeno… What is anything?<br>
<br>
z; Ha! I do not know my boy.<br>

zeno dialogue [at the fountain]<br>
<br>
z; Notice the fountain…<br>
b; What of it?<br>
z; Particularly the transformations of each glimmering droplet<br>
through the air. Can you identify a single one for any extended time?<br>
b; I’m afraid not.<br>
z; Notice too, how it seems the fountain<br>
never resides wholly in one instant, but is rather perpetually in flux.<br>
b; This is indeed true… why is it so?<br>
z; It is said it would not be fitting the majesty<br>
of the Creator to create but once,<br>
rather to create, and then perpetually recreate!<br>
