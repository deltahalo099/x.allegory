the overseer;<br>
we neither know where we are<br>
nor where we go<br>
this existence is so vast<br>
and there is so much yet to be known<br>
<br>
what do we do about this?<br>
<br>
billy; I don't know...
<br>
<br>
I will tell you what we must do, but...<br>
it will probably be the most difficult thing you have ever attempted<br>
in fact... you may never see it come to pass<br>
but you can, and in all honesty you must, advance the cause<br>
<br>
billy; I understand. Continue.
<br><br>
we, you, have to construct a wormhole.<br>
a link between various regions of space<br>
this will enable humanity to explore the farthest reaches<br>
<br>

billy; where do I start?
<br><br>
Where all great things start; wikipedia.<br>
