<br>
What shall I tell you?
<br>
If you want some simple truth that's easy to
digest, well... I can't give you that. But if
you want the convoluted mess that has been my
life. Well... Have a seat. From the outset many
would dismiss me a liar. A spinner of yarns and
fables. Sure. There is an element of uncertain
falsity to what I say. But what does it matter
whether the events I share with you happened
actually or imaginatively? Does imagination not
reveal some truths? Is not imagination grounded
in this reality? And still, if the picture I
paint is so vivid, so lucid and clear, you
can't separate fact from fiction - then what
does it matter?<br><br>

x: You claim to be a chrononaut, care to
elaborate?<br><br>

β: Ahh. Time. Your whole life, from the moment
of your inception, has been a journey through
time leading up to now. Hasn't it?<br><br>

x: Yes. That's entirely different than 'time
travel' though.<br><br>

β: Hmmm. You're right. It would be something
else entirely if an older version of you or I
walked into here trying to convince us they've
travelled backwards in time to meet us.<br><br>

x: Exactly.<br><br>

β: So how do you know the present Billy isn't
in the bathroom tied up and I'm a future
version of him come to converse with you....<br><br>

x: Wouldn't you having altered ‘present’
Billy's present altered the future and thus
you?<br><br>

β: Hmm, you make a valid point. Anyway - that
is all good and well, but I do have a limited
amount of time here and to get into the thorny
details of quantum decoherence, general
relativistic time dilation, and the Arabic
source code of the cosmic simulation wouldn't
serve the main point which is that you want to
know who I am and how I got here. That... is...
what you want to know, right?<br><br>

x: I'm not sure what I want to know. I just
found these cards lying around and followed a
trail of breadcrumbs that led me to you.<br><br>

β: Just remember these two things and all will
make sense in time:<br><br>
1. The laws of physics are invariant in
all inertial systems<br>
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the
same for all observers regardless of
the motion of the light source.<br><br>

x: I apologize for the interrogation, but you
are indeed a peculiar man, Mr. Pilgrimage.<br><br>

β: Billy is fine.<br><br>

x: You don't look much like a Billy, is that
your birth name?<br><br>

β: Tralfamadorians. That's all I have to say.<br><br>

Let’s begin.<br><br>

I was born in a small village deep in the
hypergeometric matrix of existence. To this day
I still don't know where it is precisely. The
village was a simple place, however there was
an underlying current of obscure electric
mystery that tinged everything and could never
be defined. You see, the village was entirely
encircled by these beautifully vivid trees that
seemed to glow - we called them "Sidrat." No
one ever dared cut them down - for they were
held sacred. The children would play by their
long tall trunks and collect whatever leaves
that may have fallen. On days of sadness one
would lay out in the field and admire their
beauty. Some asked where they came from, where
everything came from - the trees, the wind, the
creatures, the elders, the children, the
village itself. The answer was always some
variation on the theme - that it had always
been like this. Forever. The people in the
village were all that existed, generations came
and went, and the trees spread out to infinity.
The only exception to this was Master Zeno.
He's the only villager that is said to have
come from the outside, and because of that he
was always regarded with suspicion. Many
appreciated him - for he brought books to us
and taught the children - but still many
shunned him for he posed a threat to the
harmony of village life and our common beliefs.
No one knew if he wrote the books himself or
found them. Not many had ever ventured outside
of the village, so the books were nothing more
than an oddity in an otherwise static life.
From a young age we were taught that the
dangers out there were fierce. Any horrible
fate one could imagine for a person awaited the
poor soul who dared venture out - so the elders
said. Anyone who went out too far was certain
to never return. Some of the older children
would dare each other to venture out testing 
their bravery, but always returned crying. Yet,
a few of the elders claimed to have travelled
deep and spent long periods of their lives
there before returning. Their tales were all
contradictory and outlandish, and if what we
were always taught was true how could they have
returned? They spoke of ships, monsters,
planets, dimensions, other peoples, languages,
war, and love. We enjoyed their stories as much
as we enjoyed Master Zeno's books. It wasn't
until we got older and carefully studied the
books that we began to contemplate the nature
of truth. Some of us would gather by the edge
of the forest and discuss:<br><br>

- how do the trees choose?<br>
- where do we go when we die?<br>
- why can't we go farther into the woods?<br>
- what if everything the elders taught is a
lie?<br>
- what if the stories are true?<br>
- where did master Zeno come from?<br>
- how did this all start?<br>
- what is at the end of the forest?<br>
- what is infinity?<br><br>

The brighter the knowledge<br>
The darker the ignorance<br><br>

I don't know many things Jimmy. I hope you
don’t mind me calling you that. What I do know
is that none of it really mattered to most of
us because we all knew that we were doomed to
remain forever in the village. Well.... almost
knew. For you see, the Sidrat had a strange
habit. At indecipherable times the colors of
the trees would change vividly signaling a
call. It was the only major celebration the
village looked forward to - a strange thing to
celebrate in hindsight, but I've encountered
stranger. Anyway. Whenever the trees changed it
was certain that someone in the village was
being called. The exact means of the call
differed each time - a dream, an accident, a
break in the routine, a sign.<br><br>

Many harbored hopes that they would be the one
to be called, some would even pretend that it
was their turn venturing off into the wild and
never returning. Still others dreaded that time
out of sheer fear. It might have been a death
sentence. Hope and fear were the law. Two
things we all knew for certain - one would die
inside or outside the village. I guess that's
only one thing though - death. Most of the
elders passed their entire lives within the
village. The few who recall a time before
Master Zeno arrived, a time before books, say
the village was calmer. That electric tinge in
the air didn't exist. The Sidrat were as
mysterious as our lives itself. One could
admire their beauty from within our womb, but
as soon as you stepped out beyond the threshold
of the village you would be overwhelmed by this
sensation a mix of awe and hope and sheer
grandeur. Then they'd call you towards your
death sentence. Every step farther out would
intensify the exhilaration until you collapsed
in humility and returned to the village.
It is the most vivid dream I have ever had.
There were no images, simply a voice that said,
"go and do not return until your shadow
disappears." I woke up feeling so honored and
hopeful yet completely petrified. It felt like
I held a secret that no one in the village knew
of. At first I went and ran to the edge of the
village and stared out into the trees. I felt a
gentle breeze from behind me encouraging me to
move onwards, but I was scared. I spent a few
days in silent contemplation. No one really
took notice of me. A few ran out into the wild
claiming they had been chosen. What I learned
was that this calling was not optional, each
day that passed I felt this dread and anxiety
fill me. The entire village seemed to shrink,
and everything seemed like an illusion, like a
shadow before my eyes. So, I turned to the only
person I could - my mother. Before I even told
her it seemed that she already knew. She was
more reserved than usual, I guess she knew what
was coming. Then I thought to visit Master Zeno
as he was the one I trusted most second to her.
I walked towards his small dwelling and found
him waiting by the door as if expecting me.<br><br>

"Master Zeno, may I speak with you?"<br><br>

"Of course."<br><br>

"You know I don't listen to what the others say
about you. I study your books diligently and
there's much I wish to learn."<br><br>

"This is so."<br><br>

"Well, Master Zeno... I don't know any other
way to put this but that I believe I am the one
the trees are calling."<br><br>

"This is so."<br><br>

"I intend to leave tonight and so I wanted to
say goodbye."<br><br>

"This most certainly is not goodbye. Come in."<br><br>

This was the first time I had ever been to
Master Zeno's dwelling. I was surprised at how
simple and empty it was. I thought there would
be many books. I noticed this large beautiful
fabric hanging on the wall with some intricate
markings on it. Oddly, I also felt the coarse
grain of sand beneath my feet. Where did that
come from?<br><br>

"What is on that fabric Master Zeno?"<br><br>
"Oh. That's an Ayah from al Quran al Kareem."<br><br>
"What?"<br><br>
"We have yet to study this in our lessons. I
was always fearful it's challenge may be
difficult for the village..."<br><br>
As he said that I felt certain that he truly
did come from elsewhere. That gave me hope that
what awaited me outside the village was not as
dismal as I grew up being told.<br><br>
"Can you tell me more?"<br><br>
He stroked his beard as if in deep
contemplation.<br><br>
“No.”<br><br>
Some silence passed and then he spoke in a
hypnotic and melodious tone.<br><br><br><br>

I didn't know what it meant, but it filled me
with a conviction that what lay outside the
village would be beautiful.<br><br>
"What does it mean?"<br><br>
"To translate is to look at the world through
the window of a prison cell. However, in your
tongue it means:<br><br>
And if whatever trees upon the earth were pens
and the sea was ink, replenished thereafter by
seven seas, the words of Allah would not be
exhausted. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might
and Wise.”<br><br>
"Before you leave Billy, I want to give you
something.”<br><br>
He handed me a sword.<br><br>
It was time to leave.
