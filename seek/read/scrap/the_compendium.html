On the table sits an elegantly bound book.<br>
Titled; "The Compendium"<br>
<br>
empirical<br>
[em-pir-i-kuh l]<br>
<br>
adj. derived from or guided by experience or experiment.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. What does the universe look like?<br>
2. Where are we right now?<br>
3. Where or what is the edge?<br>
4. Are there limits to empirical knowledge?<br>
5. What exactly happens after death?<br>
6. What distinguishes death from life?<br>
<br>
7. How does large scale phenomena arise from fundamental constituents?<br>
As in, emergent phenomena - do they have their own reality? or are they limitations on perception?<br>
-- Essentially; How do atoms/fields become civilizations?<br>
<br>
8. Are space and time granular or continuous? Is Planck scale "the end."<br>
-- Does fractal geometry play a role in the dimensionality of the world?<br>
<br>
9. The question of causality and free will.<br>
-- Can there be a "real" randomness, or is it simply our ignorance of the precise details?<br>
-- And how does this matter reflect on the nature of quantum vacuum fluctuations.<br>
<br>
10. What is entropy exactly.... and how does it relate to evolution? and knowledge?
<br>
11. the eternal question - so the 3d schrodinger wave equation gives a probability distribution for the location of a "particle"
is the "reality" an actual wave like phenomena or is it really a point particle that is in rapid motion and simply has the likelyhood
of being found in a particular location - as described by the wave equation?
