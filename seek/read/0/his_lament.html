<div id="text">
the reckoner sat there in his library enveloped in the labyrinthe he hath created<br>
and resting upon his desk were sheets of spotless paper and pens of flowing ink<br>
and in the distant background an ever present noise - the hum of all existence - the sacred om<br>
and nxcx hovered by doing what it does<br>
and continued on the narrative of a thousand and one nights<br>
all who know him - and not many do - will know the reckoner is lonely<br>
for not many can bear the presence of such a tedius conceit<br>
and so in his ever present longing for communion<br>
pen and paper meet<br>
upon these reams the reckoner spends<br>
hours transfixed<br>
trying his best to arrange letters that will fix<br>
his loneliness which never ceases<br>
his longing for a mate<br>
so he writes his absent love about their nonexistent fate<br>
everything he feels and thinks everything he does<br>
finds itself somewhere in the poetry he brings<br>
all of it he keeps hidden<br>
in a special place<br>
the strangest and deepest of them all<br>
