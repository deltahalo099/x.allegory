CERTAINTY<br>
<br>
Knowledge is easy<br>
Certainty is hard<br>
<br>
How do you know what you know is true?<br>
And how do you know anything at all?<br>
<br>
I can tell you a fact, but you’ll take it as that<br>
<br>
Suppose you and a lover were standing on a shore and out in the distance were three lights flickering on and off. <br>
First the left, then the middle, then the right. And you both wonder, what is that?<br>
Are they related? Are they coincidence? Is it a single object? What’s the relationship between these lights?<br>
You come up with a reasonably satisfactory explanation, but neither of you are entirely content with it. <br>
The difference is one of you doesn’t stop thinking about it, while the other just moves on.<br>
<br>
How are you to find out? <br>
How are you to know with certainty? <br>
You could devise a model and argue that it MUST be X, <br>
because within your world of experience the only thing that comes close to these lights are X.<br>
Given your limitations you’re unable to do much else to verify, <br>
so you jot down your observations in a book and carry on.<br>
<br>
A hundred years later someone stumbles on your book and is curious about the lights as well, <br>
only that now they’re on a different side of the shore and someone has developed this magnificent device called a magnifying lens. <br>
And so they direct this lens to the lights and observe a thread tied to each one, <br>
based on this observation they conclude that you were only partially right, <br>
but in truth these three lights are an aspect of one thing rather than three individual things.<br>
<br>
Using this knowledge that person gets the idea to take a series of lenses and connect them with thread <br>
(all of this is a fictional illustration of the nature of certainty)<br>
<br>
And the process continues, each generation adding more to the wealth of observation and interpretation. <br>
But never reaching the reality and essence of things.<br>
<br>
The three lights may in reality be a strange sleeping creature with the ability to remain invisible, <br>
never hunger, and at certain times of day there appears to be a thread connecting the lights.<br>
<br>
As the collection and organization of sense experience “science” grows and the interrelations between the disparate areas are explored <br>
it becomes more difficult to advance an idea - the idea must take into account all previously understood phenomena<br>
<br>
But that does not preclude the possibility that everyone may indeed be completely wrong… <br>
You’ll just have to figure it out and try harder<br>
<br>
This is the method of science.<br>
<br>
<br>
When it comes to history the possibility of experimentation are gone, <br>
one has to rely on textual sources, human memory, video evidence, archeological evidence, <br>
and the method of explanation and verification can never be as certain.<br>
<br>
<br>
How is one to be certain and to know anything without a doubt then?<br>

<br>
CAUSALITY<br>
<br>
The notion of chance/randomness/probability. Do they have their own reality, or are they a matter of limitation regarding our knowledge? <br>
<br>
The best example is the rolling of dice.<br>
<br>
Someone will say “the outcome is up to chance” - but from a deterministic physics view the die is a complex mechanical system. <br>
All the subtle weight distribution, all the precise collisions, the position and momentum of the hand at the moment of release. <br>
The rotations for the right duration of time. We can even include the subtle electromagnetic forces between the air particles <br>
and the die as it moves through the air.<br>
<br>
In this sense there is no “chance” - just the way it MUST be given the circumstances. <br>
The outcome could be any of 6. But when I get a specific value. There’s no way it could have been another. <br>
Almost as if it were destined for that outcome to occur. Destined from the very moment the die was released from the hand.<br>
<br>
The question then, is it relevant or meaningful to then talk about what COULD have happened? <br>
It COULD have been a different number, but then in that reality it would have been destined just the same…<br>
<br>
We now extend this to the “dice roll of the universe” - from the very first instant, <br>
to the formation and explosion of stars, to the formation and accumulation of raw metals to form the earth to be positioned <br>
just the precise distance from the sun for water and life to have the possibility to emerge, to then have the right circumstances <br>
for amino acids to form to then have the process of natural selection arise to have the creatures evolve to be in the precise environment <br>
to make the right adaptations to lead to the decisions that led to further adaptation that led to certain civilizations which <br>
led to certain innovations and a certain pair of people to birth me to write this and you to read it.<br>
<br>
We’ll call that outcome “3”<br>
<br>
We could then naively ask “how did all of this arise?”<br>
<br>
And someone will respond “just chance…”<br>
<br>
After all, it COULD have been “5” and not “3,” but it’s not…<br>
<br>
This is intimately linked to the nature of the atom, because the die is composed of this fundamental substrate <br>
- whatever is at the very bottom - and it must be the interactions of these fundamentals that ultimately govern the behavior of the whole event.<br>
<br>
Which takes us to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Frankly I don’t know enough here to make any accurate statements, <br>
other than the fact that currently “particles” are no longer “points” in space, but rather probability distributions in a general cloud. <br>
And even farther still “disturbances in an all pervading field”<br>
<br>
What the that means I don’t know. How does this effect our argument? <br>
IMMENSELY - the whole case is built on the assumption that things behave a certain way. <br>
At the large human scale they appear to<br>
<br>
“Almost all scientists, wittingly or unwittingly, are realists. <br>
If they did not believe that scienti?c knowledge is telling us what the world is actually like, <br>
it is dif?cult to see what would justify the great expenditure of labour and mental energy involved<br>
in pure scienti?c research. Even in science, however, physics constrains but<br>
does not fully determine metaphysics. There is no simple entailment between<br>
the two. Their mutual relationship is similar to that between the foundations<br>
of a house and the variety of edi?ces that might eventually be erected upon<br>
them. For example, quantum physics is undoubtedly intrinsically probabilistic,<br>
but does this uncertainty arise from a necessary ignorance of deterministic ?ne<br>
detail or is it the sign of an actual intrinsic indeterminacy present in nature?<br>
While most physicists follow Niels Bohr and his successors in taking the latter<br>
view, David Bohm showed that there is an alternative interpretation of the<br>
theory that yields identical physical predictions but which corresponds to the<br>
former option of a veiled determinism (Bohm and Hiley, 1993). Since there<br>
is no difference in the empirical consequences involved between the two, the<br>
choice between Bohr and Bohm cannot be made on strictly physical grounds<br>
but appeal must be made to metaphysical considerations, such as naturalness<br>
and lack of contrivance.”<br>
