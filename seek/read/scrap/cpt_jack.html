“Here’s a scurvy world, and as scurvily we live in it… <br>
Where are the days that have been, and the season that we have seen,<br>
when we might sing, swear, drink, drab, and kill men as freely, <br>
as your cake-makers do flies? When we might do what list, <br>
and the law would bear us out in it? <br>
Nay, when we might lawfully do that, we shall be hanged for and we do it now?<br>
<br>
When the whole sea was our empire, where we rob at will?”
