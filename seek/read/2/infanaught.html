SYNOPSIS<br>
--------<br>
The year is ????.<br>
Conflicts rising.<br>
The poor getting poorer.<br>
The rich getting richer. <br>
We see the west making progress on discoveries.<br>
The east however are suffering due to their own political
desires.<br>

<br>
A group known as the MARODAARS from MAROODARIA have launched a project 
that would aim to wipe out the poor and weak wipe out those 
that would stand in the way to a world where the only the 
strongest will thrive.
Any one with the slightest hint of distractions. 
slightest sense of empathy or sympathy to another of lower rank 
will be wiped off the face of the earth 
or become one of the MARODAARS. 
They have yet to begin their research on the human inside and out
to perfect their project...<br>
Project Malice.<br>
<br>

BEGIN<br>

<br>

In a lab known as RAG013, ran by the powerful group known as 
MARODAARS, RAJAGUPTA exclaims that the time has come to show the world
its remarkable potential. To show the cutting edge of their research.

<br><br>

RAJAGUPTA GRINDER: Brothers, I welcome you to our meeting. To our viewers around the world
    we bring you peace. I have some amazing breakthrough discoveries to announce.
    We are finally on our way to unlock the secrets of the human. With that, we will
    be able to help the humans in any problems that they so have. It is a win-win 
    situation for all. We will get our benefits and society will become safer and...
    smiles disease free. <br>
<br>
NANDALI TALIPILAY: This is what we have been dreaming of my people. Those that are suffering    
    from the illnesses in the heart, mind and body will be recovered. They will be remade anew.
    Our research...the FINAL DESIGN will allow us to target a particular location in your body
    and in a way reset it that you feel like a brand new person. Our group, known as MDS will 
    finalize our research within the coming days, round up the individuals to be tested for 
    disease and cure them of it. You will be disease free and it is our promise. GEN. COVIRU VIRILU 
    will now give you his word on how crucial our research is for the betterment of MAROODARIA<br>
<br>
GEN. COVIRU VIRILU: Thank you RAJAGUPTA and NANDALI for your efforts to bringing a sense of safety to 
    our people. I cannot stress enough how important this research is as they are figuring out 
    remarkable ways to cure the human inside and out. I approve of these projects being performed
    by the RAG013 labs and we will be behind you every step of the way. By the way RAJAGUPTA, 
    what is the research specifically and how will you do it?<br>
<br>
RAJAGUPTA: smiles You will see very soon General. Everyone please be dismissed. <br>

<br>
<br>
RAJAGUPTA and NANDALI are alone in meeting room<br>
<br>
RAJAGUPTA: I have stored my research designs in a stored location unknown to the common people. <br>
<br>
NANDALI: What about the enemy of our people. The state of AMAAN and their famous scientist in lab MN001, MAADI KHAN?<br>
<br>
RAJAGUPTA: Don't worry NANDALI. I have that little problem all pre-planned out. Even if he were to get close
    to our designs, it will be no avail. I have encrypted it using a language that only you and I know. It is 
    Magharatu. Similar to that of hieroglyphics in the sense that they use pictures to depict things, 
    but oh so very different. We can encyrpt the files using a letter from that language - it would be in a form 
    of an image. And within the image could be additional encoding with additional letters from the language
    or by borrowing some things from other encoding methods such as CP1542. No one, especially that blasted researcher
    from AMAAN will not and cannot take our files.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ENTER: LAB MN001, LOCATION: MANA, AMAAN<br>
<br>
MAADI, AALIYA, and SAAD ARE working on a research project that will bring ease to people who suffer <br>
from neurological diseases<br>
<br>
<br>
MAADI KHAN: Hey AALIYA, any luck on figuring out this research?<br>
<br>
AALIYA: No bhai, I've been looking into influencing neuronal activity through resonance but I can't find the right <br>
    input for that. We have to realize that the impulse generated may negatively impact other parts of the body.<br>
    If a person is already suffering a disease mentally or even spiritually, a certain frequency might disrupt their inner<br>
    microbiome, and then what? We may have the people exhibit different problems. <br>
<br>
MAADI: Looking through files and finds an old journal Why look at this...this is my old journal that I wrote when I was<br>
    just a child. Hey AALIYA, SAAD, check this out<br>
                                                        <br>
                                                    JOURNAL ENTRY 1<br>
                                                        MAADI<br>
                    I've been thinking about our existence lately. My sister, AALIYA sometimes asks me, on <br>
                    "Why do we exist?"<br>
                    "Why do we feel regret when we do something bad?"<br>
<br>
                    I've wondered that myself. Maybe we have a disease in our body, something that even a doctor<br>
                    cannot seem to explain, and it is corrupting us, leading us to more sorrow, more misery. <br>
                    A compromise our own well-being. I want to look into this a bit more deeply. <br>
                    <br>
                    HEART<br>
                    MIND<br>
                    BODY<br>
                    SOUL<br>
<br>
                    These are the 4 elements that I think is what is impacted by our actions...if we feel regret <br>
                    due to wrong, then every element is impacted by it. If we were to influence positive, spiritual<br>
                    energy, we may be able to overcome that regretness, allow our 4 elements to heal. <br>
<br>
                    HEALING<br>
                    CURE <br>
<br>
                    Existence is tied to journey. The reason for our existence is that we were sent to a mission.<br>
                    A mission to perfect our 4 elements for another journey. This life on this world is a tutorial. <br>
                    The real life begins after this one. <br>
<br>
                    EXIST <br>
                    JOURNEY <br>
                    BEGINNING<br>
                    MIDDLE <br>
                    A NEW BEGINNING<br>
<br>
<br>
SAAD: To think that you wrote this when you were like what, 10 years old is impressive. <br>
<br>
MAADI: Thank you. I took some inspiration from an old friend. I do not know what happened to him. One day he stopped talking to<br>
    me. He was talking about really abstract concepts in Math and Physics that I did not understand at that age. I tried to contact<br>
    him and he was not gone. Ask his loved ones and he was disappeared. Perhaps he began a new journey, maybe our paths may cross<br>
    eventually.<br>
