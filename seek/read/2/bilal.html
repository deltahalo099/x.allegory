He grew up with a blazing curiosity and passion unrivaled by his peers that seemed to diminsh as he got older. The labors he pursued became more routines and norms - moreso habitual activities that kept him going rather than something inspirational and sublime, or so it would seem. That subtle shift perplexed him like any other natural mystery for a while, was it due to a genuine loss of zeal and passion? but he still carried on and couldn't imagine doing anything else.... Was he just acting out of a kind of momentum from his past and afraid to abandon what he started? Perhaps it was just the natural process of aging, the changes in brain structure manifesting as this stillness? Still further was the ever looming "bipolar" that he struggled with throughout his life. He didn't understand it as fully as he'd like let alone the interactions of all his medications. For a time he struggled with it even being real. Until finally he conceded and learned to tame it. Medication was now the norm and it was good. Exactitude and precision were his lifeblood, being unable to extract an exact solution gave him that sense of uncertainty that used to spiral him into despair. Now he lives with the ambiguity and carries on with his work. Nihaya......<br><br>

"I used to see the numbers as these distinct entities that existed out in the world and had properties to be teased apart. I was attracted to the simple fact that everything could in some sense be measured and quantified and then precise relations between entities could be determined and written down. Growing up on long field trips I would count while staring out the window. I always had the impression that the realm of mathematics itself was some otherworldly place that I was venturing into - the realm of Platonic ideals. That coupled with the apparent and hidden beauty of nature and light led me down this path that I have never let go of despite the hurdles in my journey. For years I would feel a sense of dread that everything I was doing was wasting my time, that all my pursuits and imaginings would lead nowhere. Celexa, Zyprexa, and Lithium were the trio that set things straight. The lives of the masters gave me inspiration, Pythagoras, Plato, Khayyam, Khwarizmi, Biruni, Haytham, Newton, Euler, etc. I found in them a kinship that extended beyond the confines of local time. <br><br>

The Hyperion Cube is something that I stumbled accross in my research. At first I was simply exploring the general concept of "space" and the various geometries that can exist in these spaces all within the context of physical spacetime. Initial curiosity gave way to obsession with the pursuit of these particular objects: polytopes - higher dimensional geometric forms - that lay hidden within these abstract spaces. I became consumed with the nature of these objects I was pursuing, some of my collegues told me they were nothing more than beautiful objects of contemplation, but still I felt that these structures existed in a concrete sense and that these abstract spaces corresponded to some true aspect of reality. The deeper I went the more beautiful and bizzarre the objects I found became. Eventually the level of abstraction was so straining that I could hardly make sense of what I was exploring. I gave up for a while. My mental health was in jepordy and it was putting my family under unneeded stress. My wife Nihaya respected what I did but the line between work and family was becoming too thin.<br><br>

 I formed a small research team around these topics.

Physics is assumed to produce an objective picture - in the language of mathematics (a product of the human mind) of the "world" indepedent of the human mind. I and some colleagues began to explore the line of thought that consciousess is an element of that objective world and so should be a phenomena worthy of study initself. our guiding belief was that objects of pure reflective consciousness - literally what we found in our minds - should be "real" in some non-trivial sense. our methods were admitadly avantegarde - we were derided by yhe wider community as "newage." however, physics has a reputation of producing some - nopunintended - mind bending concepts so we were granted a handsome grant to explore "speculative" ideas. our methodology gave us a deeper insight into the age old question of the true nature of mathematics and its "unreasonable efgectiveness" and several members went on to win awards and mathematics and philosophy. our research group was sizable at first until things began to become how should i say "esoteric" - those who initially left said our methods were falling outside acceptable standards, that our focus inward was clouding the true purpose of science - objectivity. as time went on minor results accumulated, many became disillusioned by the program and followed the "objectivists" - we acquired a reputation of being ritualistic and religious.<br><br>
