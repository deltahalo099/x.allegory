. . . THE SAND RECKONER<br>
<br>
What hand of fate has brought such a torturous
work to your eyes? Don't you know that the
notions preserved here are too formidable for
the feeble mind of even I? And who am I
exactly? You will know in time. Just know that
I am near, very near to you my dear reader. I
have been known by many names, some that
linger, some lost. "The Sand Reckoner" shall
suffice.<br><br>

Long ago I was tasked with the most Sisyphean
of tasks. Long ago a man by the name of
Archimedes performed a calculation in which he
sought to reckon the number of grains of sand
that may perhaps fill the universe. Despite his
intellect and the precision of his logic he
still desired to verify with certainty the
figures he recorded. And so, I was tasked with
the singular task of verification. Yes... to
determine the number of grains of sand that
fill reality! My instructions were sparse, and
I knew not where to begin, so I did what came
to me first.<br><br>
Count.<br><br>

I started from whence I found myself and began
the laborious process of counting each and
every grain of sand in existence. As you may
imagine such a task is no simple feat. The
numbers began to weigh on my mind, the
slightest lapse of memory would lead to
confusing the values. I needed a way to
preserve my day's count and so I started to
write. Days and nights would pass, and I found
that more time was spent writing than actually
counting. Slowly my mind conformed to the
nature of the sand. All I saw was motion, every
action, event, occurrence, form, all of it
seemed to be the shifting of these endless
grains. Secrets were revealed to me, which in
time shall be revealed to you. I began to 
wonder if my task would end. My body ages but
the sand continues. This one horrible question
impressed on me - if the grains are limitless
then surely I would never reach a result, yet
if they are finite still it may be so large
that I will perish before reaching the end -
how could I be sure?<br><br>

This object you are witnessing is but a
glimpse, a tangential memory of the infinite
desert of reality I have been tasked to roam.
You will hear many names, you will be puzzled,
vexed, obsessed and perhaps you may come to
find like I myself have, that time is but an
illusion...<br><br>

It is custom to begin at the beginning, but
there are no beginnings here just the
collections of events all occurring with
various relationships between them - some
precise some otherwise. Have you ever observed
the sand? I mean truly reflected on it. It has
this peculiar property akin to the definition
of entropy in physics - namely that a large
body of sand appears to change very little with
respect to the particular details of each
individual sand grain. Moving some grains from
here to there makes little difference to the
overall appearance:<br><br>
. . : . . | . . . : .<br><br>
It is the detailed arrangements of grain which
I convey to you, each letter of the alphabet so
precisely arranged conveys meaning but as a
whole produces the likeness of an expansive
desert. What you find within these webs is up
to you.
