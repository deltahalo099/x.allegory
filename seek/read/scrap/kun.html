<p>This mystery will not end<br>
This search for truth is fraught with error<br>
This precious walk between death and life<br>
Is filled with both awe and terror<br>
<br>
One blind corner<br>
Leads to two blind alleys<br>
By now you’d expect the grand finale<br>
<br>
Yet here I am<br>
Still awake<br>
Conscious of every breath I take<br>
<br>
You say that God does not exist<br>
Yet I sincerely ask - then why do we?<br>
<br>
A random blur<br>
A spontaneous out growth<br>
A grandiose cruel cosmic joke<br>
A fiction penned by some unknown author<br>
<br>
“The universe” - is all you offer<br>
<br>
And so I give you the benefit of the doubt<br>
And labor away in calculation<br>
Fields, strings, groups, codes, spheres, loops, and all other contortions<br>
<br>
“The universe” - is all you say<br>
Then carry on your merry way<br>
And I envy you in your self satisfaction<br>
As I ponder this “principle of least action”<br>
<br>
And all my friends have grown and cried<br>
Yet here I remain - with this resounding “why?”<br>
<br>
Why me or you?<br>
Or the universe?<br>
I demand an answer in a single verse!<br>
<br>
“His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, “Be,” and it is.“<br>
