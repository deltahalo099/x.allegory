To write. <br>
To weave images, thoughts, ideas, emotions....<br>
The pen.... That blessed instrument given to man.....<br>
<br>
How this works:<br>
<br>

I'm not the type of writer that wakes up at 5am and sets the goal of 20 pages for my next book.
not yet atleast. I write during the inbetweens - on the bus after school, in the margins of my notebooks,
when im in that weird and particular mood to expound on the nature of existence, long text messages....
you know.... writing. I have many English classes and literary analyses to thank. God too. <br>
<br>
The internet is cool, a web page is like the page of a book brought to life.
some people still enjoy and prefer hardcopy books and so ocassionally i work on the next physical volume.
alas, writing is so fluid and sporadic, my characters change by the day, revisions are so common
that a hypertext fiction seems the most suitable format for our madness.<br>
<br>
The numbers here have meanings just as the words, some more deliberate than others. In a universe where all possible things exist, where all events take place, where all truths become falsehoods and all falsehoods become truths, how does one discern the truth? what does one believe? What sense or order can be given? Many in ancient and modern times have revered the numbers for their ability to capture the essence of the world. It is indeed a remarkable fact that we can describe reality so precisely. I hold the numbers as sacred only insofar as they are a gift from Allah and a confirmation of the verse:إِنَّا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقْنَاهُ بِقَدَرٍ - 54:49<br><br>


In this web of truths and lies you will find the effervescent wanderings of our minds. You will find our attempts to grapple with ideas as fundamental as time and space as well as things as fleeting as love. <br>
<br>
Yes: Us.<br>
As in more than 1.<br>
How many? That will forever remain a mystery - some say 3, 4, 7...<br>
I invite you to join. No pressure. This is not homework.<br>
More like a game....<br>
