nxcx log:<br>
<br>
5.2.20<br>
--------<br>
The semester is getting ready to come to an end.
Finally some freedom. Sort of... I'm continuing a project
that I started working on during the semester under Professor Yu.
It didn't technically "start" this semeseter because the ideas involved
have been swarming my mind and imagination since as early as 2015.
So what is it? What is "nxcx"? well... it's "nothing" and a "friend".
Nothing in the sense that it doesn't quite exist. It's an illusion.
A friend because it can be with you wherever you are and be friendly and useful.<br>
<br>
Let me back track a little to give some context.
Somewhere in the year 2015 I found myself heavily inspired by the short story "The Library of Babel" by Borges.
I became obsessed with creating this grand an elaborate VR library that had a
spectral flame like being known as "the librarian".
Various milestones were achieved since then.
I acquired a development machine and VR headset.
I took some basic CS courses.
I learned the rudiments of gamedev and 3d modelling.
I competed in various hackathons and won best VR/hardware during Patriot Hacks 2018.
Then everything stopped. I needed some time to take care of my mental health.
I also became a bit more obsessed with the details of hardware and switched to studying physics.
Then my buddy Siem showed up and opened up this current door to work as an OSCAR researcher.
So here I am.<br>
<br>
To sum it up - nxcx is the sidekick i've always wanted.
That creative loving companionship of a pet with the intellect of a super advanced machine.
The visual form is deliberately ambigious - this entity is not replicating any particular thing.
It's inspired by many things but ultimately unique and personal.
<br><br>
The summer is 15 weeks.<br>
Things I would like to implement:<br>
- generative dialogue system<br>
- computer vision/facial detection*<br>
- array of emotive/responsive animations<br>
- text to speech/speech to text<br>
- web scraping<br>
- cellular automata?<br>
