. . . THE GLITCH<br><br>
it was a shady seeming parking garage, empty except for the underpaid security guard who monitored the place like a hawk. 
A thin dark figure dressed in fine cowboy gear smoking from a pipe stood against the wall keeping a low profile.
From now on he will be refered to as "Glitch" for reasons that will be made clear later.
In the inside of his leather vest rested a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Vague-Notion-Poetic-Discourse/dp/179339766X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=book+i+a+vague+notion&qid=1580659912&sr=8-1" target="_blank"> book </a> containing information that many would kill to have. They have.
Glitch was a hunted man, but this area seemed rather safe - except for the mall cop that is - enough to do business.
He was a professional man that dealt in rare goods and oddities. He kept things simple and straight forward, but he knew how to get in your head.
Some time passed and Glitch was beginning to wonder if this client would show. He flicked his wrist and took a look at his replica Rolex.
The Xolex. "Replica" is a misnomer here, for it was a precisely crafted machine that had custom features only Glitch knew how to operate.
It was only a decoy that it was branded by the famous watch company Rolex.
To say that Glitch was a man of many timezones would not be far from the truth. However the time now was for business.
Having grown impatient our merchant of death started to walk away. As he walked he noticed something peculiar, all the dirt and dust on the ground
started to gravitate to a certain point far away like iron filings to a magnet. <br><br>

"He's here" he said with a grin.<br><br>

More and more sand seemed to creep in from the void between atoms. They drew themselves to this one central point and coalesced into a tangible form.
It took a moment but then it became aparent, it was a door. As the final particles pieced themselves together the door solidified and then opened.
A bright white light flooded the place and for a moment blinded Glitch. After his eyes adjusted he could make out the faint silhoette of a man moving towards him.
The door shut behind him and collapsed back into a pile of sand. Strange.<br><br>

x: "I take it you are Glitch, correct?"<br>
glitch:	"that I am. Now, you got what I want?"<br>
x:"I'm a man of my word. But you... I don't trust you. Where's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Vague-Notion-Poetic-Discourse/dp/179339766X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=book+i+a+vague+notion&qid=1580659912&sr=8-1" target="_blank"> book </a>?"<br>
glitch: "Look bud, that magic trick with the door was neat, but I need more than your 'word'"<br>
<br>
They took a good look at each other and then burst out into laughter. The man from the door reached into his pocket and pulled out a ring.
He held it in the palm of his hand and showed it to Glitch.<br><br>

glitch:	"so this is it huh? beautiful."<br>
x: "give it some time to register your biosignatures and build an internal schema of your identity...."<br>
<br>
Mesmerized by this brilliant ring he was holding he slipped it on his finger, he couldn't comprehend how such a marvelous device - if it really was what they agreed on - could be worth such a loathesome <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Vague-Notion-Poetic-Discourse/dp/179339766X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=book+i+a+vague+notion&qid=1580659912&sr=8-1" target="_blank"> book </a>. He reached into his vest and pulled out the tattered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Vague-Notion-Poetic-Discourse/dp/179339766X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=book+i+a+vague+notion&qid=1580659912&sr=8-1" target="_blank"> book </a>.<br><br>

glitch: "here you go buddy.... You don't wanna know what I went through to get this, but looking at the ring I think it was well worth it"<br><br>

The transaction was complete with both parties satisfied. As the man from the door approached the sand that was sitting there in a pile the door reemerged.<br><br>

glitch: "Hey! Wait! Atleast give me your name..."<br><br>

The man looked at him with a stern stare and a crooked smile. "You remember. No name."<br><br>

The door shut behind him and collapsed back into sand which then evaporated away into the air.<br><br>

--end<br><br>

returning to the vast sandy domain from which he came the sand reckoner swiftly summons his staff and then
in a display of sheer will a spiral staircase materializes under his feet with each step and erodes just the same.
He climbed his way towards the large circular platform of the library and began sifting through the objects that were upon the desk.
With a quick whistle neechee flashed out of his ring. <br><br>

neechee: "yes master."<br>

reckoner: "i have acquired some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Vague-Notion-Poetic-Discourse/dp/179339766X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=book+i+a+vague+notion&qid=1580659912&sr=8-1" target="_blank"> new material</a> that needs to be indexed and added to the collection..."<br>

neechee: "i will begin right away."<br>

reckoner: "wait. I want to take my time with this one, I believe it contains some information relevant to Billy's whereabouts."<br>

neechee: "sir, why do you still concern yourself with that vagrant?"<br>

reckoner: "why do you remain my loyal companion?"<br>

neechee: "i have no choice. you created me and I am bound to you."<br>

reckoner: "fate has bound he and I and I feel a sense of responsibility for him. do you understand?"<br>

neechee: "Not completely."<br>

reckoner: "That's ok. Do as I've told you and return to your chamber"<br>

neechee: "yes master."<br>

He looked out across the vast desert wasteland that he inhabited. 
No matter where he traveled or what he learned or collected it all always led him back to here.
Back to the formless endlessness. <br><br>
He began to count.
