We find ourselves somewhere after genesis,<br>
again resting in the library.<br>
a subtle irking, a calling and desire to be liberated from<br>
the shackles of the mundane has brought us here.<br>
A pirate expedition on the intersea - <br>
<br>
"Let us see what we find today."<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
The cave in the allegory in the cave in the book<br>
in the chapter in the subsection in the line in the letter,<br>
somewhere after genesis, but before paralysis<br>
rests the current moment.<br>
<br>
Billy - now deltahalo - now omar - now lord - now master - now slave - now erased,<br>
and Aloe - now the phonics - now cicada king are rambling and rummaging and scavenging,<br>
the radio tower has been left behind, billy has travelled far enough yet never left.<br>
the strands converge at the library - the library is the completion, the unity, the core and kernel<br> 
where all events converge. delta and cicada have entered a new chapter - <br>
messages are being transmitted from an unknown source who calls himself "cpt jack"<br>
giving them orders and instructions to build a new sort of vessel,<br>
<br>
<br>
------------ Enter; Avionics<br>
<br>
Cpt Jack; "Alright you losers. Welcome to devastis, your training starts here;"</p>
