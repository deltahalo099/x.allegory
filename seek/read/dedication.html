Oh Allah, I entrust this work to you<br>
That it may be recorded in my scale of good<br>
That it may be a sadaqa ja'ria after i leave this world<br>
That it may enlighten the reader by way of allusion<br>
That it may be preserved through the generations of man<br>
<br>
Within these pages is a noble attempt in futility... <br>
The colossal infinity that stretches before and after... <br>
The places, names, forms and faces that have come to be and pass... <br>
The fleeting imaginings of our mortal minds...<br>
Monuments erected and crumbled in the sand... <br>
Written works and novel ideas... <br>
No human book could contain the transformations of the echoes through time... <br>
<br>
And yet here I am, pen to paper, etching away... <br>
For whoever may find this, in whatever realm, time, or sphere.... <br>
This humble work - is dedicated to you my dear.<br>
<br>
And so we begin - somewhere after genesis......<br>
