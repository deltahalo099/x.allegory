. . . THY HORROR COSMIC<br><br>

Long before there ever was a thing<br>
There was the one who brought all things to be<br>
The one who exists eternally<br>
Whose names are many but is solely one<br>
Whose command is “be”<br>
And it will be done<br>
And so there were the cosmic waters<br>
Whose ripples morphed and changed through time<br>
That now bear the names given by mankind<br>
Light Color Sound<br>
Star Planet Mound<br>
Galactic halo encircling ‘round<br>
Many names for a single thing<br>
All contained in verse written <br>
Manyverse<br>
Multiverse<br>
Universe<br>
<br>
We begin - sometime after genesis….<br>
<br>
<br>
I. The Cartographer<br>
<br>
Meet Billy P. P for pilgrimage. Billy is like you and I except strange things happen to him from time to time. Things that don’t always make sense. Like this one time: Billy was chilling out in the woods one day by this beautiful tree when suddenly a glowing ethereal being made of pure light materialized from thin air and approached him. It said nothing. It just drew near. Then suddenly in a flash of brilliance all types of symbols appeared - a mixture of arabic, greek, latin, sanskrit, numerals, and other unrecognizable forms and glyphs. All he felt from that day on was a love beyond earthly description. Then everything went dark.<br>
<br>
And dark it remained for quite some time. Yet slowly these strange symbols did Billy find, scattered here and there - on a wall, in a book, within a dream. It was as if a message were being conveyed to him in a language he did not quite understand. Each and every time one appeared Billy would write it down in his handy notebook - the one he kept in his trusty backpack. What was this being? What was he seeing? <br>
<br>
<br>
II. The Transdimensional Hexagram (Solomon’s Seal)<br>
<br>
Some time had passed<br>
In his notebook symbols were amassed<br>
Then like the tumbler pins in a lock<br>
Something clicked<br>
A secret was unlocked!<br>
Billy ran to Belle Isle<br>
And sat and watched the James river nile<br>
And contemplated the meaning of water and time and space for a while<br>
And with a piece of burnt wood - chalk<br>
He began to draw something intricate upon the rock<br>
Something as intricate as a clock<br>
Each circle linked with each line and glyph<br>
And Billy sat within the graph<br>
And as he sat he began to laugh<br>
“How silly of me. What am I thinking?”<br>
Lo! A transdimensional rift opened and Billy was sinking<br>
He knew not what forces were at play<br>
But his intuition seemed to lead the way<br>
For whatever happened to him that light filled day<br>
Was something brilliant - here to stay<br>
And before long Billy was somewhere else…...<br>
<br>
<br>
III.0 New Alexandria<br>
<br>
Before we continue I must mention that from this point on things will get a bit chaotic. You see, it would seem that our lives are our own, that what we do and want and say only involves us and maybe a few people around us. This is far from the truth. We are all woven into the tapestry of existence and every thing we do causes a ripple that extends outwards into the vast unknown. It’s not always clear to us what these ripples are and most of it is outside our control, but that does not mean they aren’t there. And so Billy’s life is about be inextricably linked into the lives of many others.<br>
<br>
III.1 An Emissary<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, elsewhere in a region of space far far away from this tiny little planet called earth there was a man who went by no name, quite literally “Emperor No Name.” Emperor No Name was the emperor of 7 galaxies: The Milky Way, Canis Major, Segue 1, Sagittarius Sphr, Ursa Major II, Reticulum II, and Triangulum II. Simply known as “the Sultanate of 7 galaxies” by those in-the-know. How he came to possess such a vast empire is a tale for another day. Suffice it to say, No Name was powerful. He possessed the ability to manipulate matter and energy far beyond what most earthlings could conceive. In fact the reason he has no name is because he is so distant from those he rules over that his identity remains unknown. There’s an old legend about Marco Polo and the Mongol Khan. It was said that the Khan’s empire extended so far that he could never fully know what was in it. An invading army might have approached and the battle already been decided long before news of it ever reached the Khan himself. Emperor No Name knew of this legend and so had created an elaborate system of stargate portals to link the far reaches of his empire. No Name was a fierce but just man. Those who knew him well knew that his heart was set on one thing - finding his long lost daughter Sunyata. And so one day upon reviewing his maps he noticed that there was a small planet on the outer edge of the Orion arm of the Milky Way galaxy that he had never sent a search party to. The Emperor - being fond of grand displays of extravagance - called upon one of his trustees and ordered him to go to this planet and erect a stargate portal so that it could be linked to the remainder of the empire. Who would refuse access to an empire so vast and filled with riches? If he caught any news of his daughter he was to report back immediately. “You have entrusted me my liege and I will not fail you.”<br>
<br>
III.2 The Merchant and the Academy<br>
<br>
Billy awoke. “Where am I” he asked a stranger on the street. “You are in New Alexandria, are you a traveller?” the stranger replied. “Um… I guess so. I think I’m lost. Can you help me?” he asked in a sincere plea. The stranger gave him a puzzled look and thought for a moment then said “I own a shop in this city. You can stay in the storage room for some time until you get your bearings.” And so the stranger took Billy in. In exchange for a few hours work he would feed and shelter the boy. “This is my daughter Rena, she is the head of an academy here in the city. She will help you get around. If there’s anything you need just ask her or myself. Understood?” Billy nodded in gratitude. “Yes.”<br>
<br>
	“So where are you from?” Rena asked while searching for the key to unlock the main door of the academy. “I… Where are we again?” he murmured. “You’re a bit odd you realize? How about an easier question then. If you had to choose between vision and hearing which would you?” Billy thought the question was odder than what he asked, yet it penetrated him deeply, as if she genuinely wanted to know him. He thought about it for a minute. “Hearing. You can’t see behind you, but you can hear behind you. You?” “Hmm, pragmatic. That’s a good reason. I would keep hearing too, although because I love the sound of people’s voices. Well, here it is. My father helped me build this place, he realized that all the commerce and material possession in the world meant nothing if the citizens were too dumb to appreciate how it all came to be. We don’t accept anyone though, only those who we believe have some special talent or rare gift. We help them cultivate it and turn it into something they can share with the world. What do you think?” Billy looked around in amazement. There were all forms of painting, writing, drawing, machinery, instruments, tools, liquids, vials, diagrams. It seemed like something from another world. Or at least not from the world that he had come from. He was still trying to formulate what might have happened to him. As he flipped through some of the books left open on a table he noticed symbols that looked exactly like the ones he had seen. “What are these!” he exclaimed. “Oh, that’s differential geometry. Do you like mathematics?” Billy repeated the word slowly “Ma-th-e-ma-tics,” I don’t know what that is, but I have seen it before!” “You’re this grown and you have never seen mathematics before… I find that hard to believe. Are you from some remote village or something?” she said in a facetious but totally honest way. Billy was about to answer but he hesitated. He knew that if he tried to explain where he was just the other day and how he ended up here she wouldn’t believe him. So he remained silent. He just looked at her and remembered the love he felt the day the light turned on. It wasn’t quite the same, like a dimmer glow, but still of the same source. Anyway…. “I am having a special fair in a few days. Some of my brightest students will be here, you should come!” <br>
	<br>
									“I’ll be there.”<br>
<br>
III.3 Thy Horror Cosmic!<br>
<br>
Denizens of the earth<br>
Do not think that I have come to bring peace<br>
I have not come to bring peace, but a sword<br>
I am sent by the great Emperor No Name - Sultan of 7 galaxies<br>
If you will simply submit to his rule a stargate portal will be erected<br>
Granting your planet access to the rest of the empire<br>
All you must do is utter these words<br>
لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br>
<br>
The leaders of men laughed<br>
“Who is this human who claims to reach the stars?!”<br>
“Throw him in the asylum”<br>
“This is nonsense!”<br>
“Fairies and unicorns! Ha!”<br>
“Pseudoscientific garbage!”<br>
Et al<br>
<br>
Some heeded the call<br>
For they knew that mankind was not destined to remain fixed to the earth<br>
The vastness of the heavens called out in a friendly voice<br>
“Come. There is plenty here.”<br>
<br>
- a few weeks later -<br>
<br>
All citizens of this here space ball, be forewarned. Tests for Emperor No Name's stargate transit system will begin within the next few weeks. If you notice weird weather fluctuations or strange animal behavior or begin to see strange things - know that it is a byproduct of the intense electromagnetic activity of the "machine." It is advised to reduce use of all electrical devices and remain comfortable in your bed - it will all be over soon.<br>
Thank you.<br>
The Council<br>
 <br>
III.4. A little girl and a time loop<br>
<br>
The fair went well<br>
The children did their show and tell<br>
No parents allowed - they were too old<br>
Billy admired all the neat things<br>
Stars and rings<br>
Plasma strings<br>
Floating orbs<br>
Talking borgs<br>
All sorts of shining gold<br>
The academy was filled with joy<br>
And Billy felt a sense of peace<br>
As he roamed to the far east wing<br>
There was<br>
A little girl with an old man - Omar Khayyam - her guardian<br>
They waved at Billy, told him to come near<br>
They handed him a book of gossamer<br>
On it read “Aleph Null”<br>
The little girl said: <br>
“No Name seeks, as do you, keep this truth always in view”<br>
“When he asks, you will say - it has been 10,001 days”<br>
And then they vanished into the air....<br>
<br>
What the hell man.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV. The Storm<br>
 <br>
And so the machine was prepared. All the effort had culminated in this marvelous device that would usher in the reformation of humanity. Once the stargate opens and is threaded all the survivors of this planet will have access to the wealth and riches of Emperor No Name’s great empire. The supporters of the construction effort came to be regarded as an eccentric cult by the “leeches” - the name given to all those who chose to remain ignorant of the coming events, those who refused to believe such a thing was possible, those who out of fear of the economic and political subversion such an occasion would bring sought to tighten their grip on their material possessions and worldly power. But it is too late.<br>
As soon as the relay stations are primed all the transmitters will begin emitting a synchronized electromagnetic wave across the globe. The synchrony and resonance between the transmission ensamble and the ionosphere will ultimately reconfigure the atmosphere into the desired geometry to allow the stargate to have an unimpeded link to the dark energy filaments surrounding the outer layers of the earth.<br>
However, this harmonization process is not immediate and as a result of the gradual transformation massive weather disruptions will ravage the planet on a scale never seen before. Just before equilibrium is reached the entire planet will be engulfed in chaos. Those who were conscious of and awaiting the day prepared and sought proper shelter.<br>
Everyone else - annihilated.<br>
It was often discussed whether such a heavy price was worth it….<br>
But it didn’t matter anymore.<br>
The stargate was here. The intergalactic age began….<br>
No Name smiled<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
But where is Sunyata?<br>
<br>
<br>
V. To tie some knots. To untie some others.<br>
<br>
A lot went down those following years. The earth adjusted to its new order. The star gate went from being a novelty to being an ordinary aspect of life. But what was its role in things? There were some who remained on the earth, after all, it had been refreshed and things could begin anew. There were those who came to visit infrequently, as tourists to see where mankind had originated. Others still were immersed in the new freedoms and excitement of being a part of an advanced intergalactic civilization and simply forgot the name “earth.” Still others were overwhelmed by the sheer scale of everything. How was one to take it all in? What purpose was there to such a massive world? How to deal with an exponential increase in choice?<br>
<br>
And Billy? Well through a host of events tangentially related to other events that occurred both simultaneously, in the past, and in various futures - which involved more symbols, portals, conversations, several alien species, a band, loves that never flourished, ships that crashed, lights and dreams, visions, and all other other-worldly things he found himself stranded on a distant planet somewhere in all the chaos. All the past events were fading away from his memory. He began to acclimate to this new place, it wasn’t like he had never been stranded who knows where before. Had he learned nothing though? He opened up his bag and pulled out his notebook. Looking over all the notes he had taken he had this sense of relief. He wasn’t sure how he would escape this place, but he knew he would - why else would the child entrust him with this fragile book? Finding this “Emperor No Name” figure was on his list of things to do. He looked out towards the sky and trusted that whatever brought him through all of this would continue to guide him. Billy remained content exploring his new home. One day while roaming the dense forests of this place he heard a distant hum. As he approached the hum began to take the shape of a rhythm. As he approached further still the rhythm became a distinct chanting, something that was both strange yet extremely familiar. It’s presence reminded him of that day long ago when the ethereal being approached him. Through the trees he saw a domed temple with various people wearing all kinds of robes and hoods. Fascinated, he approached the main door. <br>
Atop the entrance was inscribed:<br>
لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br>
<br>
Master Zeno (of elea): Billy. Come in.<br>
Billy: How do you know who I am?<br>
Master Zeno: Why do you not know who I am?<br>
Billy: How would I know that…?<br>
Master Zeno: The same way you knew to come here. Now hurry. Eat. Rest. We have much to do.<br>
…<br>
<br>
<br>
VI. Outro<br>
<br>
Billy: What you mean to tell me is that there are multiple realities running simultaneously with ours?<br>
Master Zeno: In so many words, yes.<br>
Billy: So what I have been experiencing is this larger reality becoming apparent to me?<br>
Master Zeno: The scope of your conscious mind temporarily expands to reveal this reality to you. The creator has given each soul a capacity for receiving divine truth. In order to receive them one must go through various stages of preparation. Your task now is to strengthen your mind so that it can hold onto that level of perception longer.<br>
Billy: And what of these symbols?<br>
Master Zeno: All books are written in some language. Correct?<br>
Billy: Yes.<br>
Master Zeno: Would you agree that life itself seems to share the characteristics of a book.<br>
Billy: I suppose.<br>
Master Zeno: There is your answer.<br>
Billy: You mean to say that we are all written in a book?<br>
Master Zeno: Us. The trees. The stars. The breeze.<br>
Billy: Then who is the author?<br>
 <br>
وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَامٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ <br>
<br>
And if all the trees on earth were pens and the oceans ink, with seven oceans behind it to add to it, yet would not the words of Allah be exhausted: for Allah is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.<br>
