<div id="text">
there they lay<br>
musing about nothing<br>
reminscing about all the nothing<br>
Billy continually reminding aloe that<br>
something needs to be done<br>
whatever it may be<br>
for, to give up would be a tragedy<br>
a life should not be wasted<br>
<br>
aloe says "I probably shouldn't have eaten so much"<br>
"I wonder if she needs this as much as I do"<br>
<br>
Billy replies<br>
"que sera sera"<br>
<br>
aloe is now asleep<br>
it's past midnight<br>
Billy continues to toil - his mind restless<br>
this flame has consumed him<br>
to create is to breathe<br>
he refuses to conform his vision to the world<br>
it's the world that must be molded and manipulated<br>
arranged in a harmony that carries through<br>
filled with dissonance and resolve intermittently
