>>>> "Human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"<br>
<br>
>>>> "The quest for "artificial flight" succeeded when the Wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds and started using wind tunnels and learning about aerodynamics.<br>
Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making "machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool even other pigeons."<br>
<br>
Intelligent Agents: <br>
any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
Problems:<br>
-------------------------<br>
reasoning/problem solving:<br>
&nbsp;	> logical deduction<br>
&nbsp;	> probabilistic reasoning<br>
<br>
knowledge representation:<br>
&nbsp;	> ontology: objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described (web ontology language)<br>
&nbsp;	> the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions.<br>
&nbsp;	> "subsymbolic knowledge + reasoning" - non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies (see situated AI, computational intelligence, or statistical AI)<br>
<br>
planning:<br>
&nbsp;	> setting and achieving goals<br>
&nbsp;	> representing the state of the world<br>
<br>
communicating:<br>
&nbsp;	> NLP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;		Syntax:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			morphological segmentation<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			Text-to-speech<br>
<br>
perception: <br>
<br>
action:<br>
<br>
learning:	<br>
Machine learning is essentially a form of applied statistics with increased emphasis on the use of computers to statistically estimate complicated functions and a decreased emphasis on proving conﬁdence intervals around these functions; (frequentist estimators and Bayesian inference)<br>
&nbsp;	> Unsupervised learning: the ability to find patterns in a stream of input<br>
&nbsp;	> classification<br>
&nbsp;	> regression - to predict an output given an input<br>
&nbsp;	> transcription - turn unstructured data into textual output (optical character rec, speech rec)<br>
&nbsp;	> translation - textual input of one language converted to textual output of another<br>
&nbsp;	> anomaly detection<br>
&nbsp;	> synthesis & sampling*<br>
&nbsp;	> imputation of missing values<br>
&nbsp;	> denoising<br>
&nbsp;	> density estimation<br>

Fields of Influence<br>
-------------------------<br>
Computer Science/Engineering<br>
	• How can we build an efficient computer?<br>
<br>
Mathematics (probability, statistics, logic, calculus, linear algebra)<br>
	• What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?<br>
	• What can be computed?<br>
	• How do we reason with uncertain information?<br>
<br>
Psychology<br>
	• How do humans and animals think and act?<br>
<br>
Linguistics<br>
	• How does language relate to thought?<br>
<br>
Philosophy<br>
	• Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?<br>
	• How does the mind arise from a physical brain?<br>
	• Where does knowledge come from?<br>
	• How does knowledge lead to action?<br>
<br>
Neuroscience <br>
( https://scienceblogs.com/developingintelligence/2007/03/27/why-the-brain-is-not-like-a-co )<br>
	• How do brains process information?<br>
<br>
Economics (rationality, decision theory, game theory, utility)<br>
	• How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?<br>
	• How should we do this when others may not go along?<br>
	• How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?<br>
<br>
Control Theory<br>
	• How can artifacts operate under their own control?<br>
<br>

"Can Machines Think?"<br>
------------------------------<br>
Substrate Neutral<br>
Physical Symbol System Hypothesis (newell + simon): any system capable of manipulating symbolic data - adding numbers, rearranging lists of symbols, replacing symbols, etc is capable of "intelligence" (top down)<br>
<br>
Substrate Dependent<br>
(John Searle) - thinking only occurs in protein based "machine" i.e. biochemical<br>
<br>
Subsymbolic Processing - processing of signals (neural networks, bottom up)<br>
<br>
parallel vs serial processing<br>
binary vs fuzzy logic<br>
neuron > switch<br>
<br>
empiricism - all knowledge is rooted in sensory perception <br>
(linking symbolic processes to sensors)<br>
