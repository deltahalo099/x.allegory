the incemenation germination fertalization efflorescense decadence and ultimate decay of the billy pilgrimage enterprise aka a short story about the development of a story that grew into a novel yet unwritten

as was the case i’m laying on a bench in the gym of a juvenile prison

for several months i would drift off into naps and upon awakening find a poem fully formed on the edge of my awareness

this particular day all i remember was the phrase “flight of the pheonix” transforming into “plight of the phonics”

and it stuck - over a few weeks i made notes of a potential thematic musical album i’d create upon release using some of the musical ideas that i developed

i had been under the sway of these deep archytpal symbols - this one incident where i tried to paint a desert, hated the outcome, poured hand sanitizer on the canvas, erased the junk, and ended up with an image that more closely resembled what i had in mind

i impulsively drew two small figures traveling in this barren scene

that continued to plauge my mind - who were those two? obviously one of them was me, but the other?

that role was filled by a few people as time elapsed

at first i thought it was my good friend hunter - i had recently finished reading this sufi book that made a distinction between “sober” and “drunken” sufis and i was undecided as to whether i was drunk or sober….

(i realize anyone reading this is going to have great difficulty fully connected all the loose strands - there’s just far too much information compressed in my memory to begin to adequately treat with words. and i think it may be better this way. anyway… digression…)

so me and this unknown figure wandering in the desert of a discarded painting

one calm afternoon in the art classroom only myself the teacher and the spanish teacher from next door occupied the room

having a sense of reverence for the man - many conversations. very humbling story.

i asked him “what does the image of the desert signify?

he told me “leaving this world”

_____________ end desert theme

next came the issue of the door

my bunk mate (we slept on bunk beds) asked me this riddle i had heard before but simply could not remember the answer nor figure it out anew

about two guards before two doors - one always lying one totally honest and having one question to determine which door the treasure lay behind

that incident initiated this deep internal crisis i’m not sure i can even now articulate…. just an intense feeling of collapse internally - i was deeply troubled by this innocent riddle

skip to another moment and i’m asking the english teacher i had met a few times this vague question about doors and drunken sufis and my friend hunter…..

skip again and the two doors collapsed into one single door located in the desert

skip yet again and i’m sitting on the floor outside the office of the cleaning crew in the isolation unit and the door that’s there suddenly becomes a physical manifestation of this allegorical door that’d been occupying my psyche

_________ end door theme

and so now these themes of “plight of the phonics” “the desert” and “the door” interwove into this amalgamous soup that yet had no name - just a latent pool of creative fertility

realse from prison. alexandria. school. english 112. slaughter house five.

slaughter house five.

let me tell you what happened with that book. basically the dissociated nature of time billy experienced coupled with the whole tralfamadorian time sense and shit left this lasting impression of a timeless time

of an eternal moment

of being trapped in amber - yet expereincing a dissociated collection of moments that could be strung together in hindsight

added to the overwhelming sense of unfulfilled creativity all these strands

doors deserts movement memory time moments eternity
condensed into a poetic revelation (the famed key to the book)

-through the desert
-past the door
-abandon words
-waters of gracious reflection and song
-subtelty of the wind
-through the needles eye
-7 windows to an unseen sky
(not the full poem)

and that became the encrypted key for the entire thing
__________

it continues!

after the in amber project imploded on itself (HTTPS://SOUNDCLOUD.COM/INAMBER) i figured it was time to reorient myself away from music - thus billy pilgrimage became my defacto pseudonym - adapted directly from Billy Pilgrim in slaughter house five - and dump bucket for all the musical sketches and ideas i’d record or work on (i like the juxtaposition of a generic american name “billy” with the more universal associations with pilgrimage)

the musical projects under that heading were to thematically follow this large story arch where each album was itself a wordless book yet when taken all together each would simply be a chapter in the larger story.

this idea remains central.

as i said though, i was trying to distance myself from music - it easily becomes crippling - i was growing less seduced by it

billy pilgrimage’s pilgrimage though remained…. the music wasn’t capturing enough of the nuance and detail and depth of the actual experinces that were its inspiration so the next medium ultimately became words themselves

pen and ink

the poem serving as the kernel for the entire journey
growing into the table to content
the knowledge filling in the gaps between the themes
the experiences like sand grains fitting ever more tightly
all so seamless

a single book containing all of reality…..
each lesser book simply binding a faint trace. an etching of the internal majesty of the single book….

billy simply travels through.

adieu
