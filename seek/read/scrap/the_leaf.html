>>>>>>the leaf<br>
It was the break of night and nothing but the cars on the freeway could be heard.<br>
I had entered after chasing a girl to the end of the world and back, <br>
only to realize I had only traced my self<br>
formed a subtle shell and erased myself<br>
the flowing outpaces the I<br>
wiped like the shore does leave<br>
<br>
a pirates life for me, on the ether sea (aka ethernet) knowledge stolen between<br> finger tips<br>
knowledge stolen as do quick flightly glances love<br>
worn I straggled on, into creation, the rolling waves dissipating<br>
into bloody trails left haunted by the eras ended, kings and men<br>
kings and mortar<br>
the sealed up border between life and death rent asunder<br>
red with ire did it flow<br>
my saber's edge by moon did glow<br>
zulfiqar<br>
<br>
the spine straightener<br>
neural highway into absolute tought<br>
<br>
I type to you now in an hour of need, in the declines of freedom from pain<br>
into the clutches of ache<br>
of too many places<br>
too many forms crackling my bones<br>
<br>
an embellished myth for the birth of a new nation<br>
recorded in collective imagination and sacred text<br>
passed down by generations<br>
what is this phenomena we call time?<br>
destroying as it creates<br>
passing by, flowing through, rearranging us<br>
<br>
was i not really born from dust?<br>
and what is at odds with what scripture tells us?<br>
this evolutionary path the river did hollow<br>
glaring into nothing follow<br>
my eyes rather dim<br>
a charred ember of what they once had been<br>
a mind dulled by the smooth droll of the passing days<br>
up lifts the page<br>
<br>
searching for the remedy
