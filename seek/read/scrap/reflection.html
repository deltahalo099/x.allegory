You see… I could feign this sense of continuity and coherence - put up this facade that a narrative thread were weaving the loose vignettes<br> together - but I’d be a liar. And a liar has no place on this ship - as ironic as that may seem.<br>
<br>
A loosely strung gang of people heading towards an ill defined goal - at times uncertain, at time unwavering along the way.<br>
<br>
And let me clarify - there is no CONSCIOUS thread. As to whether in the ultimate end it will all have appeared nice and sequential to you (the reader) I will leave an unresolved matter.<br>
<br>
Just know that the tralfamadorians taught me something valuable;<br>
<br>
“There isn’t any particular relationship between the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once,<br> 
they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. <br>
There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. <br>
What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.” <br>
