Sometime after genesis...<br><br> 
You stand before the door, ominous and alluring. Inscribed just above, "read" in fluid Arabic script.<br>
Beyond the door lies a realm replete, a juggernaut. You enter. <br>
Beneath you stretches a large circular platform suspended within a great black expanse. <br>
Along the edge a marble railing knee high inlaid with gold leaf and incomprehensible writing encircles the platform.<br>
Subtly etched into the floor is a lowercase Greek lambda (λ). <br>
A single soft and angelic glow shines from the unreachable heights tingeing everything with embracing warmth. <br>
Dust particles like autumn leaves dance with the light and swirl gently through the air. <br>
Rich purple hues mixed with deep ocean blues give the place a calming stillness. <br>
The mere sight of it all evokes a sweet phantom scent of arcane tomes.<br> 
This is home.<br><br>
Just over the edge; shelves towering like ancient obelisks, <br>
shelves wrapping around in concentric rings, <br>
shelves reaching outward into the abyss as far as the eye can see, ascending upward towards eternity and downward just the same.<br>
Within this space lies a noble attempt in futility. <br>
The colossal infinity that stretches before and after, the places, names, forms, and faces that have come to be and pass.<br>
Monuments erected and crumbled in the sand, written works and novel ideas.<br>
No human structure could contain the transformations of the echoes through time.<br>
And yet here we are.<br><br>
Off to the side of the platform, hovering patiently and gracefully, a spectral being,<br>
 as ephemeral as a flame, bioluminescent and cool to the touch. <br>
 Composed of the world's glyphs - Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Japanese, etc. <br>
 - morphing into one another and perpetually fading out of existence. <br>
It militantly scours the vast expanse, sifting, indexing, arranging, retrieving, awaiting any order. <br>
It is the gatekeeper and the guardian, a custodian of humanity's collective intellect.<br>
On the opposite side rests a humble desk. Pen, paper, a keyboard, and an assortment of disheveled books; the tools of a scholar.<br> 
However, these are no ordinary books. <br>
Inside, the pages have this translucent quality, as if they were made of some sort of alien plasma or liquid crystal.<br>
The pages smoothly glide over one another with the flick of a wrist.<br>  
Their texture is like that of water, which is to say they have no distinct texture at all.<br><br>
I'm looking for Richard Feynman's lectures on physics.<br>
In a whirling flurry the shelves collapse to a swarm of pixelated dust then vanish, momentarily leaving nothing but the abysmal darkness,<br> only for the atoms to then recoalesce into a new form. <br>
Floor 12,567,443 - physics. <br>
True to its nature the bibliospecter ventures out into the ocean of books and returns with precisely what is asked for,<br>
"The Feynman Lectures on Physics."<br>
You open the book.<br>
A 3 dimensional hologram emanates from one of the pages - Feynman in the digital flesh,<br>
standing before the chalk board lecturing on the deepest natures of reality;<br>
quantum electrodynamics, entropy, mechanics, relativity and Newton's laws. <br>
On the adjacent page rest a myriad of equations and formulae.<br><br>
"I need to review trigonometric identities."<br>
This time the platform rises one floor, the massive shelves shifting with the internal logic of a monolithic Rubik's cube.<br>
Floors; floors upon floors upon floors abound with the collected scrawl, moans, sighs, and all other forms of artistic, cathartic, informational riff raff.<br> 
Floor 1,659,453,235,778 is dedicated solely to works on unrequited love; poetry, novels, audio recordings, paintings, all of it.<br> 
Floor 9,145,986?  a collection of memoirs written prior to 1802. <br>
Floor 12,567,444 nothing but mathematics. <br>
Floor 73,234,758,345 - archived Facebook pages of the deceased.<br><br>
There is no hope in this place. <br>
The world's knowledge accessible at any instant, colossal and overwhelming, entirely worthless. <br>
It is not the information that carries intrinsic value, it is the seeker who imbues the noise with meaning. <br>
You start to think, "it's ironic how civilization is made of sand, like one elaborate sand castle. <br>
Our buildings, our roads, our glass, our computers."<br>
Silicon dioxide to be exact.  <br>
In a romantic way it serves the truism "all shall crumble," the waves of time obliterating everything. <br><br>
Like an early morning dream recollection, the voice of Archimedes rings - "There are some, king Gelon, who think that the number of the sand is infinite"<br>
Were we to stop here, we would not be at fault in thinking that civilization may indeed carry on indefinitely into the future, continually building on itself.<br>
But, Archimedes continues; "there are some who, without regarding it as infinite, yet think that no number has been named which is great enough..." <br>
and with that, the door closes behind you. <br><br>
You take off your virtual reality HMD, shut down your computer, and retire to the comforts of your own bed.
