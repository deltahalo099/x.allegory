Cantor’s cathedral<br>
<br>
“I wanted escape… or something akin to it.<br>
You know that feeling when you’re a child staring at a clean sandbox<br>
or blank sheet of paper? Maybe an unmarked notebook,<br>
that infinite potentiality, the symmetry after the placement of the pen.<br>
Just before any marks are made. That’s what I was after.<br>
<br>
I slipped into a reverie one still noon<br>
and I was engulfed in a torrent of absolute and utter brilliance,<br>
the window before me extended well beyond my vision, <br>
I was overcome with such grandeur and majesty that the apparent flow of time totally went extinct. <br>
When I woke back every nerve in my body commanded me to construct this… <br>
I’ve been laboring ever since…”<br>
<br>
Cantors cathedral. <br>
A mammoth light radiating through the window. <br>
Dust particles suspended in amber air. <br>
Staring fixed. <br>
Inside each another cathedral. <br>
Inside which a mammoth light. <br>
Shining on a grain of dust. <br>
Inside which another cathedral. <br>
Staring fixed on a wave of light. <br>
Suspended in a grain of dust. <br>
Inside which the borders break. <br>
Inside which there’s none to take, <br>
but walls of light suspended in grains of dust, each certainly must….<br>
<br>

“How is it you create the cathedrals within the dust particles?” Billy naively asked<br>
Cantor; “The question, Billy, is how do these damn dust particles keep getting into my cathedrals?!<br>
Between every ray of light my dear boy is one infintely more bright!<br>
<br>
Light upon light!
