The written word seems to carry with it a sense of silent dignity. <br>
To think - what actually is none more than etched scrawl on refined tree bark has <br>
the capacity to create civilizations, to incite love and hate, to move men to war, <br>
to repair and reform - all that we are, can be, will be, is ink flowing across the page.<br>
<br>
Shifting hands<br>
Shifting lands<br>
Shifting form<br>
