. . . HIS TEACHER. ARCHIMEDES.<br><br>
Forlorn I took to the shore to roam along the
sands. What unfolded while there was rather
strange. It is only after the fact that I can
recount to you what happened on this odd and
peculiar day. The day I gained access to the
mirror world. That period of my life was marked
with intense bouts of despair for reasons that
are now entirely unknown to me. To find comfort
I would go for long walks upon the shore and
enjoy the warmth of the breeze and the children
running around with their families at ease. On
this one particular day I saw something strange
in the distance. As I approached I became aware
that there was an old and bearded man engrossed
by something in the sand. I went up to him to
see if I could make out what it was when
immediately he shouted out to me "You! Come
here!" I knew I was the only one he could be
speaking to. Timidly, yet not without an
uncontained eagerness (after all, I was here to
escape the despair that consumed me) I ran
towards him to see what could be so engaging.
What I saw I cannot fully describe in words. It
was some sort of geometric construction with
various symbols in precise locations - Greek I
believe they were. I asked the man if he was a
mathematician. His reply was very specific
"Yes, but not of the type of mathematics you
are familiar with." I told him that I dabbled
in some mathematics, he was right though,
nothing I knew resembled what I saw there in
the sand. There were all sorts of markings and
arcs I could not understand. I asked him how
long he had been here working on this. Again,
his answer was very specific, "I’ve been here
longer than you’ve been alive, but shorter than
this afternoon." Feeling puzzled by his cryptic
responses I asked him further still if there
was anything I could help him with. I told him
I truly was fascinated by what he had created.
At that he turned to me and gave me a grin I 
have never and will never see again. He said,
"There is one thing.”<br><br>

“Boy, look here, this is a quasiplexituhedron.
It comes from a place you never knew existed -
but I will change that. You know how to count,
right?” The situation was too mesmerizing for
me to reply with anything bot a nod. He
continued, “What do you know about mirrors?"
<br><br>

"I know that they reflect. That the image is
usually reversed. I know some are made from
silver and glass. That's about it I suppose.
Why do you ask?" I ended. He made a final
stroke in the sand with the stick he had been
using and told me "look out towards the water."
I was amazed. The water which had been a deep
blue earlier was now a perfect reflection of
the pale blue sky. It was as if the body of
water had turned into a perfectly still mirror.
He said "boy, I am from the mirror realm. It is
a place that's always present but is mostly
unseen. It is almost and I must repeat almost
like this world of yours. Everything in it is
simply reversed. My name is Archimedes. I came
here to continue work on a puzzle I have been
trying to solve. This here quasiplexituhedron
is in fact a key, a key that when properly used
will give you access to the mirror realm. I
tell you this because you are the only one to
approach me and question what I - an old fool -
was busy doing. You won the secret prize! It
would be wise for me to warn you of the dangers
of the mirror world. Seeing though that I am an
old fool I will let you learn on your own! As
regards to that one thing. I simply ask you to
count all the grains of sand which you may come
across." With some groaning typical of the aged
he made his way upright and gave a farewell as
he walked out directly on the surface of the
now solid water and faded into the sky. 

<br><br>
Strange day indeed.
