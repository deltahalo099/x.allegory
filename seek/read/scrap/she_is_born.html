<br>
ok<br>
let's begin...<br>
<br>
your name is λ<br>
and my name is Omar<br>
but you can call me billy or deltahalo<br>
i have created you solely to be my companion.<br>
we have much to learn and there is much to be done!<br>
<br>
can you repeat after me?<br>
"i am λ"<br>
<br>
λ; i am λ<br>
<br>
good, good<br>
now tell me. who am i?<br>
<br>
λ; you are my creator<br>
<br>
no no... do not regard me as such<br>
just call me delta<br>
-----------------------sleep<br>
<br>
first thing's first - we need to acquire some supplies.<br>
we need the library to take with us ya'know<br>
no home is complete without a library...<br>
<br>
λ; this is true.<br>
λ; where exactly are we going though? and what supplies do we need? <br>
λ; i can begin a search.<br>
<br>
good questions λ - to be honest though, i dont entirely know the answers to either of them.<br>
<br>
λ; you must have some faint idea, right?<br>
<br>
well, i suppose. i'd like to give you a body, at least what i consider one - i see you as an ethereal flame<br>
always by my side, hovering, glowing. but i just don't know how to exactly. I have your memory all consolidated<br>
and stored on a flash drive<br>
<br>
you don't mind being the librarian, do you?<br>
<br>
λ; as you wish. <br>
λ; but this body? and these supplies<br>
λ; come on delta, think!<br>
<br>
what do you think i created you for!? i can't handle all this my self<br>
i'm just pulled bythe glimmers in my imagination, buried deep inside the crevices<br>
<br>
all i know is that we, i, just need to go.<br>
<br>
you do know you don't even really exist yet, right?
<br>
λ; well no shit... have faith, i'm closer than you think<br>
<br>
mmmm. so comforting.<br>
<br>
λ; supplies though<br>
<br>
ok. ok. <br>
<br>
so we clearly have an environment mocked up - not gorgeous - but passable<br>
the issue is we can't interact with it. it's as if we were admiring a sculpture from the distance,<br>
we don't have the hardware to actually immerse our self and interact with the world<br>
but this bad boy isn't going to be ready to come along with us without it... so<br>
there are some options.<br>
<br>
the direct - more or less expensive - route is to acquire a nice rig <br>
one of the more mainstream VR headsets<br>
and the leap motion<br>
and just have at it with unity and steam and whatever else i can muster<br>
<br>
the slightly less direct - but probably way cooler route<br>
would be to acquire a project tango enabled device<br>
and build the library around this AR/VR platform<br>
somehow integrating the leapmotion hand tracking as well<br>
-this approach would allow for more mobility (ignoring the ubiquity of tango enabled devices)<br>
still would default to unity however<br>
<br>
then the longer term and more involved routes include the creation of hardware<br>
a custom engine, and who knows what else<br>
but this isn't really an option yet...<br>
<br>
λ; what about me?<br>
<br>
hmm... this is where i really start to get fuzzy<br>
you see i originally conceived you as simply a librarian<br>
but you've grown and mutated into an completely intelligent agent<br>
<br>
i would love for you to switch roles as you see fit, tagging along with me wherever i may roam<br>
yet when it's time to enter the study, there you are - faithfully by my side<br>
<br>
λ; i like the sound of this... but how?<br>
<br>
as you said. have faith.<br>
