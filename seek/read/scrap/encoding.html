Encoding--------------------------<br>
<br>
Any type of experience can be encoded into bits<br>
by some transducer. We take those bits and store<br>
them in little memory containers and give<br>
them structure.<br>
<br>
A curriculum is simply the sequential acquistion<br>
of preserved accumulated sense data <br>
(text books, microscope slides, films, memoirs, lab results, etc.)<br>
Any "field of study" or line of inquiry is a large collection of data<br>
associated with some particular phenomena or aspect of reality.<br>
every field has its current state, as well as a history, and they are continually<br>
changing, and crosspolinating and dying out.<br>
<br>
In an infinite library one may find things that<br>
are both meaningful and not. It is not the data that has<br>
inherent meaning, it is the experiencer of the information<br>
that gives it relvance and frames it in some context.<br>
<br>
information can simply be thought of as some form - some momentary<br>
configuration of the present or past or future state of reality<br>
(be it subjective or objective)<br>
<br>
Whether this reality fundamentally is granular; like sand<br>
or continuous; like water, is still an open question because<br>
no one has come close to exploring the planck scale.<br>
<br>
A sufficiently intelligent librarian could scour the library<br>
and retrieve data stored and shared across all machines,<br>
(think accessing digitized archives from around the globe)<br>
<br>
The library itself can be coded as a simple markup that restructures<br>
any given data into an aesthetically pleasing and intuitively interactive<br>
form.<br>
<br>
every "book" can be given a set of metainformation tags to help in catalogging<br>
(author, title, date, language, location, topics, content, themes, genre, etc)<br>
and associating content with branches of knowledge. The content of individual pages<br>
can be indexed and tagged as well to aid in the search for relevent phrases and questions.<br>
<br>
additionally - given the immense processing power available and on such small scales<br>
one could easily imagine creating motionpicture like 3d scans of objects, people, professors<br>
to be preserved and archived.<br>
<br>
- picture a 3d bust of richard feynman giving his famous lectures on physics instead of<br>
a youtube video.<br>
<br>
The library itself is organized in a fractal-like, tree like heirarchy<br>
codex>branches>floors>books>page>(line, word, glyph, bits)<br>
<br>
seeing as the method of search is based on metadata and indexing, the need<br>
for a concrete classification system is unnecessary, so long as the illusion of order<br>
and shelving is given - then when the specific data is requested it can simply "appear"<br>
- this is a point i'm not entirely sure on however<br>
<br>
basic datastructure types i imagine would include;<br>
.shelf = similar to a folder - but closer to a briefcase or a drive perhaps<br>
.book = equivalent to what we now call folders, large compilations of relevant project data<br>
.page = these would be the main units, marked up almost like html and css, you could have<br>
embedded video, web articles, icons, sketches, hand writing data, sound files, 3d "pop out" objects etc.<br>
<br>
